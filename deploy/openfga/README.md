# OpenFGA + AgentGateway `ext_authz` dev stack

This folder contains the OpenFGA seed model and gRPC bridge used by the
`docker-compose.dev.yaml` `rbac` profile. AgentGateway calls the bridge through
Envoy gRPC `ext_authz`; the bridge adapts that request to an OpenFGA `Check`.

## What runs

| Piece | Role |
|-------|------|
| `openfga-postgres` | Durable OpenFGA metadata |
| `openfga-migrate` | One-shot DB migration |
| `openfga` | OpenFGA API (HTTP `:8080`, gRPC `:8081`, Playground `:3000` **inside** the container) |
| `openfga-init` | Creates store `caipe-openfga`, writes authorization model, optional coarse AGW tuple |
| `openfga-authz-bridge` | Small Envoy gRPC `Authorization.Check` service — AGW calls `openfga-authz-bridge:9100`; bridge decodes JWT `sub` from request headers (unverified, **dev only**) and calls OpenFGA `Check` |

Published host ports are bound to localhost only: **18080** (OpenFGA HTTP),
**18081** (gRPC), **13002** (Playground), **9100** (bridge). Override them with
`OPENFGA_HTTP_PORT`, `OPENFGA_GRPC_PORT`, or `OPENFGA_PLAYGROUND_PORT` if needed.

## Important: gateway authorization

With the default `deploy/agentgateway/config.yaml`, **every** MCP request is
authorized by AgentGateway `extAuthz`:

1. `jwtAuth` validates the Keycloak-issued token.
2. `extAuthz` asks the bridge to run an OpenFGA `Check`.

The AgentGateway path no longer maintains CEL `mcpAuthorization` rules or a
Mongo-backed config bridge.

The bridge has no subject allowlist. For a concrete human MCP target it checks
the existing `mcp_server#can_invoke` capability, falls back to
`mcp_server#can_discover` for agent-mediated global access, and treats a direct
`owner` grant as private for trusted personal/DM context enforcement. Restricted
targets still require `can_invoke`. Service accounts keep their explicit
gateway, agent, and caller-tool grants; a service-account owner cannot execute a
private MCP server.

Application routes use the Centralized Authorization Service (CAS), which can
combine persisted Mongo visibility, trusted interaction context, and OpenFGA.
The AgentGateway bridge remains a separate Python enforcement point because the
gateway may consume the bearer token and provide only verified JWT metadata to
`ext_authz`; it therefore cannot securely call the public subject-bound CAS API
as the end user. Moving this check behind CAS requires a dedicated authenticated
internal CAS protocol, not a caller-supplied subject header.

`mcp_server#private_marker` remains in the authorization model as an inert,
deprecated compatibility stub for one rolling upgrade. New code never checks or
writes it. Keeping the relation temporarily prevents old bridge replicas from
failing while a new model is activated; it can be deleted after every bridge is
on the capability-based implementation.

## ReBAC model

The model is intentionally richer than the current coarse AGW check:

| Object | Relation | Purpose |
|--------|----------|---------|
| `mcp_gateway:list` | `can_call: [user]` | Current route-level AGW `extAuthz` gate for MCP browse/list/init traffic. |
| `team:<slug>` | `member: [user]` | Team membership from Admin UI team members. |
| `agent:<agent_id>` | base `user`, `manager`; derived `can_use`, `can_manage` | Dynamic agent use/manage grants from Team Resources. |
| `tool:<server>/*` | base `caller`; derived `can_call` | AgentGateway runtime grant for every tool on a concrete MCP server. Team Resources expands "all MCP servers" into one tuple per registered server. |
| `knowledge_base:<id>` | base `reader`, `ingestor`, `manager`; derived `can_read`, `can_ingest`, `can_manage` | Reserved for the KB admin surface. |

When `OPENFGA_RECONCILE_ENABLED=true` on `caipe-ui`, saving
`Admin → Teams → Resources` writes the corresponding team/resource tuples before
persisting the Mongo team document. The writer checks tuples before writes/deletes
so repeated saves are idempotent.

Slack channel grants use OpenFGA-safe channel subject ids:
`slack_channel:<channel_id>`. Avoid embedding a second `:` in the
object id portion because OpenFGA treats `type:id` as a structured user string and
rejects malformed users.

## Migration and backfill

Existing Mongo team memberships, team resource assignments, and one-agent-per-channel
Slack mappings can be converted into ReBAC provenance records with:

```bash
MONGODB_URI='mongodb://...' MONGODB_DATABASE=caipe \
  npx ts-node -P tsconfig.scripts.json scripts/backfill-universal-rebac.ts

APPLY=true MONGODB_URI='mongodb://...' MONGODB_DATABASE=caipe \
  npx ts-node -P tsconfig.scripts.json scripts/backfill-universal-rebac.ts
```

The script defaults to dry-run and prints the number of membership source records,
relationship records, Slack channel grant records, and skipped Slack mappings it
would upsert. Slack mappings without a workspace id are skipped so they do not
collapse into a shared synthetic subject. Use `APPLY=true` only after reviewing
the counts. Roll back source-scoped membership sources, relationship records, and
Slack channel grant records with:

```bash
SOURCE_ID=backfill-universal-rebac MONGODB_URI='mongodb://...' MONGODB_DATABASE=caipe \
  npx ts-node -P tsconfig.scripts.json scripts/rollback-universal-rebac-tuples.ts

APPLY=true SOURCE_ID=backfill-universal-rebac MONGODB_URI='mongodb://...' MONGODB_DATABASE=caipe \
  npx ts-node -P tsconfig.scripts.json scripts/rollback-universal-rebac-tuples.ts
```

## Quick start

1. **Set your Keycloak user `sub`** (from any access token — jwt.io):

   ```bash
   export OPENFGA_SEED_SUB="<uuid-from-token-sub-claim>"
   ```

2. **Bring up** OpenFGA + bridge **with** the usual dev stack (`rbac` profile so `agentgateway` exists):

   ```bash
   docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yaml --profile rbac up -d \
     openfga-postgres openfga-migrate openfga openfga-init \
     openfga-authz-bridge agentgateway
   ```

3. **Exercise MCP through AGW** as usual (`http://localhost:4000`). If OpenFGA denies, you get **403** before the request reaches the MCP backend.

## Security warnings

- The bridge **does not verify JWT signatures** — it only base64-decodes the payload for `sub`. Acceptable **only** on a private Docker network where AGW has already enforced `jwtAuth: strict`. For production, pass verified claims from AGW gRPC `ext_authz` metadata or verify JWTs in the bridge with JWKS.
- **Do not** expose port `9100` to the public internet.

## Next steps (out of scope here)

- Map `jwt.active_team` into OpenFGA checks for team-scoped gateway decisions.
- Shadow mode (legacy vs OpenFGA disagree metric) — not implemented in this minimal stack.
