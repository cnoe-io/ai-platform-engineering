## Tagging convention

See [CI/CD & Releases](../development/ci-cd-and-releases) for the full branch flow and tag shape reference.

## Running a workflow manually

Any workflow with `workflow_dispatch:` can be triggered from the GitHub UI:

1. Go to **Actions** → select the workflow
2. Click **Run workflow** → choose the branch → fill in inputs → **Run**

Or via CLI:

```bash
gh workflow run release-finalize.yml \
  --repo cnoe-io/ai-platform-engineering \
  -f version=0.4.9
```
