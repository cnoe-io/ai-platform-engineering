# Orphaned Tool Call Repair for Bedrock Multi-Turn Conversations

**Status**: Implemented
**Category**: Bug Fix / Resilience
**Date**: February 24, 2026
**PRs**: [#842](https://github.com/cnoe-io/ai-platform-engineering/pull/842) (supervisor fixes), [#31](https://github.com/cnoe-io/cnoe-agent-utils/pull/31) (OTel fix)

## Overview

Fixes that improve supervisor resilience during multi-turn conversations with sub-agent delegations when using AWS Bedrock as the LLM provider. Addresses orphaned tool calls that permanently break conversations and a `response_format` incompatibility with Bedrock's Converse API.

## Problem Statement

### 1. Orphaned Tool Calls Break Multi-Turn Conversations

**Symptom**: After 2-3 turns involving sub-agent delegation, users see:
```
✅ I've recovered from an interrupted tool call. Let me continue processing your request...
❌ Recovery retry failed. Please ask your question again.
```

**Root Cause**: When a sub-agent call (e.g., `AWS_Agent`, `GitHub_Agent`) times out or the client disconnects mid-stream, LangGraph records an `AIMessage` with `tool_calls` but no corresponding `ToolMessage`. On the next turn, Bedrock's Converse API rejects the conversation with:
```
ValidationException: Expected toolResult blocks at messages.0.content
for the following Ids: tooluse_y6Ma8ihoB4Lqbmm4bumT7p
```

**Impact**: Conversation becomes permanently broken for that context. Users must start a new session.

**Frequency**: Common in multi-turn conversations with sub-agent delegations, especially when responses are large (ArgoCD listing 800+ apps, GitHub listing many PRs).

### 2. Bedrock `response_format` Causes Prefill ValidationException

**Symptom**: Sub-agents using `aws-bedrock` provider fail with:
```
ValidationException: This model does not support assistant message prefill.
The conversation must end with a user message.
```

**Root Cause**: LangGraph's `create_react_agent` with `response_format` appends a hidden `AIMessage` prefill. Bedrock's Converse API does not support assistant message prefill, causing every structured response attempt to fail.

**Impact**: Sub-agents fall back to error handling, producing `ResponseFormat` orphaned tool calls that cascade into the supervisor.

## Solution Architecture

### Fix 1: Enhanced Orphaned Tool Call Repair

**Location**: `ai_platform_engineering/multi_agents/platform_engineer/protocol_bindings/a2a/agent.py`

The existing `_repair_orphaned_tool_calls` was enhanced to detect tool call IDs across all Bedrock-specific message formats:

```python
def _extract_tool_call_ids(msg: BaseMessage) -> set:
    """Extract tool call IDs from all possible locations in an AIMessage.

    Bedrock stores tool_use IDs in three places:
    1. msg.tool_calls[*]["id"]           - standard LangChain format
    2. msg.additional_kwargs["tool_use"] - Bedrock additional_kwargs
    3. msg.content[*] blocks with        - Bedrock content block format
       "type": "tool_use" and "id" key
    """
```

**Pre-fallback repair**: Before entering fallback streaming mode, the supervisor now attempts orphan repair:
```
⚠️ Supervisor: Found 1 orphaned tool calls. IDs: ['tooluse_y6Ma...']
🔧 Will remove AIMessage with orphaned tool_call
✅ Supervisor: Removed 1 AIMessage(s) with orphaned tool calls
```

**Force-repair**: For persistent Bedrock errors, extracts tool_use IDs directly from the error message via regex and removes matching `AIMessage`s from state.

### Fix 2: Bedrock response_format Bypass

**Location**: `ai_platform_engineering/utils/a2a_common/base_langgraph_agent.py`, `ai_platform_engineering/multi_agents/platform_engineer/deep_agent.py`

When `LLM_PROVIDER=aws-bedrock`, the `response_format` parameter is omitted from `create_react_agent` and the format instructions are embedded directly in the system prompt instead. This prevents the prefill `ValidationException` at its source.

### Fix 3: Safe Summarization Boundary

**Location**: `ai_platform_engineering/utils/a2a_common/langmem_utils.py`

`_find_safe_summarization_boundary` was enhanced to prevent splitting `tool_use` / `toolResult` pairs during context compression. If a `ToolMessage` in the "keep" zone references a `tool_call` in the "summarize" zone, the boundary shifts to include the corresponding `AIMessage`.

### Fix 4: OpenTelemetry Context Detach Noise Suppression

**Location**: `cnoe-agent-utils/cnoe_agent_utils/tracing/decorators.py` (separate repo)
**PR**: [cnoe-agent-utils#31](https://github.com/cnoe-io/cnoe-agent-utils/pull/31)

Added `_quiet_span_exit()` helper that temporarily raises the `opentelemetry.context` logger level to `CRITICAL` during span exit, preventing noisy `ValueError: <Token var=<ContextVar...> was created in a different Context` errors from polluting logs.

## Reproduction and Verification

### Multi-Turn Reproduction Test

The orphaned tool call issue is reproduced by sending 5+ turns to the supervisor using the same `contextId`, with queries that trigger sub-agent delegations:

```bash
CONTEXT_ID=$(python3 -c 'import uuid;print(uuid.uuid4())')

# Turn 1: GitHub sub-agent delegation
curl -sN -X POST http://localhost:8000 \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":"t1","method":"message/stream","params":{"message":{"role":"user","parts":[{"kind":"text","text":"List 2 recent open PRs for cnoe-io/ai-platform-engineering"}],"messageId":"m1","contextId":"'$CONTEXT_ID'"}}}'

# Turn 2: ArgoCD sub-agent (same context, builds history)
# Turn 3: Cross-reference (triggers summarization pressure)
# Turn 4: Context window check
# Turn 5: Another delegation to push context further
```

An automated integration test is available at `integration/test_orphan_repair_multiturn.py`:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=. uv run python integration/test_orphan_repair_multiturn.py
PYTHONPATH=. uv run python integration/test_orphan_repair_multiturn.py --turns 3
```

**10-turn summary**: 9 completed, 0 failed, 1 timeout (Jira cold-start), 0 recovery failures, 0 fallback triggers.

No orphan repair was needed in Run 2, confirming that the upstream prevention fixes (Bedrock `response_format` bypass, safe summarization boundary) are effective at eliminating the root causes.

**Error counts across both runs**: 0 `Recovery retry failed`, 0 `fallback`.

## Decision Rationale

### Why repair at the supervisor level?

The orphaned tool call problem is inherent to LangGraph's checkpoint system with Bedrock. When a stream is cancelled, the checkpoint records the `AIMessage` with `tool_calls` but the `ToolMessage` response is never written. Repairing at the supervisor level (before the next LLM call) is the only place where we can access the checkpoint state and fix it before Bedrock rejects it.

### Why embed response_format in system prompt for Bedrock?

Bedrock's Converse API fundamentally does not support assistant message prefill. LangGraph's `create_react_agent` uses prefill internally when `response_format` is set. Rather than patching LangGraph, we bypass the issue by embedding the format instructions in the system prompt -- achieving the same structured output behavior without triggering the prefill.

### Why extract tool_call IDs from three locations?

Bedrock's Converse API stores tool_use information inconsistently across LangChain message formats. During normal operation, IDs appear in `tool_calls`. After checkpoint recovery, they may only exist in `additional_kwargs` or `content` blocks. Checking all three locations ensures no orphaned tool call is missed regardless of how the message was serialized.
