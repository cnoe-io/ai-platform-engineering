# What is a Prompt Library?

A **prompt library** is a curated collection of carefully designed prompts intended for use in multi-agent systems. These prompts guide AI agentsâ€”such as "Platform Engineer" or "Incident Engineer" personasâ€”by providing standardized questions and instructions that facilitate effective collaboration, incident response, platform operations, and knowledge sharing.

* Prompts are **meta-level**: They focus on coordination, decision-making, troubleshooting, and collaboration between agents.
* Prompts are **tested and validated**: Ensuring they are effective for real-world use in roles like incident management and platform engineering.
* A prompt library makes it easy for teams to **reuse**, **share**, and **maintain** high-quality instructions, leading to more reliable and efficient AI-driven workflows.

A prompt library empowers multi-agent AI systems with proven, reusable prompts that improve communication, coordination, and decision-making in complex systems like Platform Engineering.
