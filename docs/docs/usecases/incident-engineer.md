# Use-case: Incident Engineer

## Enhanced Incident Management with PagerDuty, Jira, Agents, and Runbooks

### Overview

Integrating PagerDuty, Jira, intelligent agents, and runbooks with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances incident management by combining automation, collaboration, and AI-driven insights.

### Key Features

- **PagerDuty Integration**: Real-time alerting and incident response coordination.
- **Jira Integration**: Seamless tracking and collaboration for incident resolution.
- **Intelligent Agents**: AI-powered agents assist in detecting anomalies and providing actionable insights.
- **Runbooks with RAG**: Dynamic retrieval of relevant runbook steps using RAG ensures accurate and efficient incident resolution.

### Benefits

- Streamlined incident response workflows.
- Improved collaboration across teams using Jira.
- Faster resolution with AI-driven recommendations.
- Enhanced operational efficiency through automated runbook execution.

### Example Workflow

1. **Detection**: PagerDuty triggers an alert for a detected anomaly.
2. **Analysis**: Intelligent agents perform root cause analysis using historical data.
3. **Prioritization**: Incident is logged in Jira and categorized based on severity.
4. **Resolution**: RAG retrieves relevant runbook steps and provides actionable recommendations.
5. **Post-Incident Review**: Insights are documented in Jira to refine processes and prevent recurrence.

### Tools and Technologies

- **PagerDuty**: Incident alerting and response coordination.
- **Jira**: Issue tracking and team collaboration.
- **AI Agents**: Automated anomaly detection and analysis.
- **Runbooks with RAG**: AI-enhanced retrieval of resolution steps.

### Getting Started

To run the Incident Engineer persona:

```bash
# Using the generated docker-compose file
cd docker-compose
docker compose -f docker-compose.incident-engineer.yaml --profile a2a-p2p up

# Or generate it fresh with dev mode
make generate-compose PERSONAS="incident-engineer" DEV=true
```

The Incident Engineer persona includes:
- PagerDuty agent for incident alerting
- GitHub agent for code analysis
- Backstage agent for service catalog integration
- Jira agent for ticket management
- Confluence agent for documentation
- Komodor agent for Kubernetes troubleshooting

### Conclusion

Leveraging PagerDuty, Jira, intelligent agents, and RAG-powered runbooks transforms incident management into a proactive, efficient, and collaborative process.
