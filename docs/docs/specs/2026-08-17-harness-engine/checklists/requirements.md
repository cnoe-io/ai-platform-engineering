# Specification Quality Checklist: Harness Engine

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-08-17
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No unjustified implementation details; Agent Sandbox is an explicit user-selected architectural constraint
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION]` markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are externally verifiable, including the requested pod-isolation boundary
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] Named technology constraints are limited to the requested harness and sandbox scope

## Notes

- Validation iteration 1 passed on 2026-08-17.
- Validation iteration 2 passed after Agent Sandbox research on 2026-08-17.
- Validation iteration 3 passed after thread persistence, long-term memory, and distributed tracing were made explicit on 2026-08-17.
- Validation iteration 4 passed after the harness-aware agent creation/edit/clone flow, field-addressable validation, switch preservation, active-conversation policy, stale-response handling, accessibility, and BFF write ordering were made explicit on 2026-08-17.
- Product names in FR-008 define the requested integration scope; implementation choices and adapter mechanics are reserved for the plan.
- “Exact same functionality” is made testable through the existing-test gate, portable baseline, compatibility report, and explicit exclusion of byte-identical model prose.
- Pod isolation is made testable through unique claim/Sandbox/pod UIDs, stale-generation fencing, credential canaries, egress denial, eviction recovery, and 1,000-binding isolation.
- State continuity requires a committed external thread head; memory has explicit scope/revision/provenance; tracing has W3C parentage and leak/outage gates.
- Agent creation preserves the existing five-step editor and legacy default while making harness-first model filtering, compatibility explanations, and exact-payload server validation testable.
