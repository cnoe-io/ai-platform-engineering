# Tasks: Harness Engine

**Input**: Design documents in `docs/docs/specs/2026-08-17-harness-engine/`
**Prerequisites**: [spec.md](./spec.md), [plan.md](./plan.md), [research.md](./research.md), [data-model.md](./data-model.md), [mongodb-migration.md](./mongodb-migration.md), [quickstart.md](./quickstart.md), and the contracts beginning with [rest-api-v1.md](./contracts/rest-api-v1.md)

**Tests**: Required. The specification makes unchanged compatibility tests, contract tests, conformance tests, isolation tests, and UI tests release gates. Test tasks precede the implementation they verify.

**Task format**: `[ID] [P?] [USn] Action in exact path — requirement(s); verifiable done condition`

- `[P]` means the task can run in parallel with adjacent `[P]` tasks because it changes different files and has no incomplete dependency.
- `[USn]` maps directly to User Story `n` in [spec.md](./spec.md).
- A task is complete only when its stated test or observable condition passes. Do not mark implementation tasks complete from code review alone.

## 2026-08-18 Implementation Amendment: Independent AgentCore Slice

This amendment supersedes any task below that edits `ai_platform_engineering/dynamic_agents/` for the first implementation slice. Those tasks remain future migration backlog only. The current release gate is zero changed paths under that package.

- [x] T117 Create the independent Python package, locked dependencies, and non-root container in `ai_platform_engineering/harness_engine/` — done when the service imports and its image has an isolated entrypoint.
- [x] T118 Add operator-owned AgentCore runtime aliases and reject arbitrary runtime identifiers in `src/harness_engine/config.py`, `models.py`, and `adapters/agentcore.py` — done when adapter tests prove the exact AWS request and bearer-token non-propagation.
- [x] T119 Add independent harness overlays, owned runs, ordered events, optimistic revisions, indexes, and TTL in `src/harness_engine/repository.py` — done for memory and Mongo repositories.
- [x] T120 Implement detached provider tasks and stable AgentCore `runtimeSessionId` ownership in `src/harness_engine/coordinator.py` — done when provider work is not scoped to an SSE request.
- [x] T121 Implement catalog, overlay, run, cancel, cursor replay, and SSE endpoints in `src/harness_engine/main.py` — done when internal credential and owner isolation tests pass.
- [x] T122 Add disconnect/replay E2E in `tests/test_disconnect_replay_e2e.py` — done when a run completes with no event subscriber and later replays from a cursor.
- [x] T123 Add stateless BFF proxies under `ui/src/app/api/harness-engine/` with internal-service authentication and existing OpenFGA/conversation checks — done when Jest proves the user bearer is not forwarded and `Last-Event-ID` resumes a subscription.
- [x] T124 Add browser run/replay/subscribe helpers in `ui/src/lib/harness-engine-session-client.ts` — done when the public client contract separates start from subscription.
- [x] T125 Add harness-first Agent Creation UI selection and AgentCore runtime alias fields in `DynamicAgentEditor.tsx`, persisting only an independent overlay — done when existing editor tests and the AgentCore conditional-field test pass.
- [x] T126 Document service boundaries, configuration, and disconnect semantics in `ai_platform_engineering/harness_engine/README.md` and update this plan — done when limitations distinguish client disconnect survival from engine-process failover.
- [x] T127 Add deployment manifests and production secret wiring for the independent service without placing it in the default first-install profile — `docker-compose.caipe-oss.yaml` adds the service only to the explicit preview overlay, keeps Dynamic Agents untouched, builds the additive UI from the branch, and validates against the upstream Compose file.
- [ ] T128 Add engine-process takeover/reconciliation for in-flight provider invocations — future reliability phase; browser/BFF disconnect survival is complete without it.
- [x] T129 Add stable provider thread identity plus validated W3C tracing storage/propagation for AgentCore runs — done when repeated conversation turns share a `runtimeSessionId` and the trace reaches the allowlisted runtime payload.
- [ ] T130 Add the provider-neutral long-term MemoryBroker with explicit user/agent/organization scopes — future phase after the AgentCore session slice.

## 2026-08-18 Harness Gateway Vertical Slice

- [x] T136 [US1] Persist an allowlisted `execution_harness_id` in the BFF-owned
  `dynamic_agents` record and default missing legacy records to Dynamic Agents —
  done when create/edit payloads retain the selected runtime without changing
  Dynamic Agents source.
- [x] T137 [US1] Implement deterministic target resolution in
  `ui/src/lib/harness-gateway.ts` — done when the selected marker routes to
  Harness Engine and missing/default markers preserve the existing DA proxy.
- [x] T138 [US3] Implement canonical-to-AG-UI and canonical-to-custom SSE
  translation in `ui/src/lib/harness-gateway.ts` — done when lifecycle and text
  frames are consumed unchanged by existing clients.
- [x] T139 [US1] Route the existing BFF start, invoke, cancel, and resume paths
  through Harness Gateway while preserving existing authentication, OpenFGA,
  and conversation checks — done without changes under
  `ai_platform_engineering/dynamic_agents/`.
- [x] T140 [US7] Add caller/agent/conversation-scoped active-run cancellation
  to Harness Engine without clearing the durable session binding — done when a
  follow-up run reuses the binding after cancellation.
- [x] T141 [US3] Add BFF compatibility coverage proving browser, Slack, and
  Webex AG-UI traffic routes through AgentCore and add Harness Engine cancel
  coverage — done when targeted Jest and pytest pass.
- [x] T142 Document the Harness Gateway boundary, routing marker, disconnect
  behavior, and current capability gates in the spec, plan, tasks,
  architecture, and Harness Engine README.
- [ ] T143 [US3] Add provider-neutral interrupt resume to the adapter contract
  and Harness Gateway — blocked as a capability for the initial adapters, not
  silently delegated to Dynamic Agents.
- [ ] T144 [US3] Add attachment normalization/storage references to Harness
  Engine — blocked as a capability for the initial adapters with explicit
  `HARNESS_CAPABILITY_UNSUPPORTED` responses.

**Current gate**: `git diff main...HEAD --name-only | rg '^ai_platform_engineering/dynamic_agents/'` produces no output; Harness Engine pytest/ruff, BFF Jest, editor Jest, ESLint, and TypeScript checks pass.

## Phase 1: Setup and Compatibility Freeze

**Purpose**: Establish a measurable Dynamic Agents oracle before changing runtime behavior.

- [ ] T001 [P] Capture the current generated OpenAPI document and route/status/header fixtures in `ai_platform_engineering/dynamic_agents/tests/contract/fixtures/` and add the snapshot test in `ai_platform_engineering/dynamic_agents/tests/contract/test_openapi_compatibility.py` — FR-001, FR-006; done when the unmodified service matches the committed baseline.
- [ ] T002 [P] Capture deterministic custom SSE and AG-UI golden frames for text, reasoning, tools, warnings, subagents, interrupts, resume, cancel, error, and finish in `ai_platform_engineering/dynamic_agents/tests/contract/fixtures/streams/` with replay tests in `ai_platform_engineering/dynamic_agents/tests/contract/test_stream_compatibility.py` — FR-002; done when current output passes byte-for-byte.
- [ ] T003 [P] Inventory current configuration fields, Mongo collections/indexes, cache keys, metrics, environment aliases, middleware outcomes, built-in tools, and error categories in `docs/docs/specs/2026-08-17-harness-engine/compatibility-matrix.md` — FR-001–FR-007; done when every row names a source path and baseline test ID.
- [ ] T004 [P] Add deterministic fake-model/tool benchmark scenarios and a baseline runner in `ai_platform_engineering/dynamic_agents/tests/performance/benchmark_compatibility.py` — NFR-001, NFR-002, NFR-005; done when it records first-response, total-turn, event, memory, and cleanup baselines.
- [ ] T005 Create `contract/`, `conformance/`, `integration/`, `performance/`, and `security/` test packages under `ai_platform_engineering/dynamic_agents/tests/` with shared neutral fixtures in `ai_platform_engineering/dynamic_agents/tests/fixtures/` — FR-007, NFR-004; done when pytest collects each package without collection errors.
- [ ] T006 [P] Record locked versions, licenses, transitive dependency diffs, network behavior, credential needs, and vulnerability review status for all four adapters in `docs/docs/specs/2026-08-17-harness-engine/research.md` — FR-011, FR-035; done when every adapter has an explicit enable/block decision.
- [ ] T007 Amend `.specify/ARCHITECTURE.md` to state that all agents execute through Harness Engine and Deep Agents/LangGraph is the default compatibility harness — plan architecture gate; done when no living-architecture statement requires every agent to be LangGraph-native.

**Checkpoint**: The current implementation is frozen as a black-box oracle; no runtime behavior has changed.

---

## Phase 2: Foundational Contracts and Persistence

**Purpose**: Add provider-neutral types, validation, persistence, and routes that block every execution story.

**Critical**: All remaining user-story phases depend on this phase.

- [ ] T008 [P] Add failing Pydantic compatibility tests for absent, valid, unknown, oversized, and unsafe `harness`/`memory` fields in `ai_platform_engineering/dynamic_agents/tests/contract/test_harness_models.py` — FR-005, FR-012–FR-015, FR-055–FR-057.
- [ ] T009 Implement `HarnessConfig`, `MemoryPolicy`, descriptor, capability, validation-report, session-binding, lease, and canonical-interrupt models in `ai_platform_engineering/dynamic_agents/src/dynamic_agents/models.py` — FR-005, FR-009–FR-015, FR-044, FR-051–FR-057; done when T008 passes and legacy documents serialize unchanged.
- [ ] T010 [P] Add canonical-event schema and lifecycle state-machine tests in `ai_platform_engineering/dynamic_agents/tests/contract/test_canonical_events.py` — FR-002, FR-016, FR-026, FR-029.
- [ ] T011 Implement the canonical event union and validator in `ai_platform_engineering/dynamic_agents/src/dynamic_agents/services/harnesses/events.py` — FR-026–FR-029; done when T010 rejects duplicate, late, malformed, oversized, out-of-order, and post-terminal events.

- [ ] T019 Implement `GET /api/v1/harnesses`, `POST /api/v1/harnesses/validate`, and sanitized per-harness health in `ai_platform_engineering/dynamic_agents/src/dynamic_agents/routes/harnesses.py` — FR-009–FR-014, FR-069–FR-073; done when reports include request ID, catalog revision, payload fingerprint, stable field path, step ID, constraints, and data-only fixes.
- [ ] T020 Register additive harness routes and partial readiness in `ai_platform_engineering/dynamic_agents/src/dynamic_agents/main.py` and `ai_platform_engineering/dynamic_agents/src/dynamic_agents/routes/health.py` — FR-006, FR-035; done when existing route snapshots remain unchanged.
- [ ] T021 [P] Add harness feature flags, default resolution, adapter capacity, and compatibility aliases to `ai_platform_engineering/dynamic_agents/src/dynamic_agents/config.py` and `ai_platform_engineering/dynamic_agents/src/dynamic_agents/services/config.yaml` with tests in `ai_platform_engineering/dynamic_agents/tests/test_harness_config.py` — FR-005, FR-034–FR-037.
- [ ] T022 [P] Add stable harness/adapter/execution-mode labels and redaction guards to `ai_platform_engineering/dynamic_agents/src/dynamic_agents/metrics/agent_metrics.py` with tests in `ai_platform_engineering/dynamic_agents/tests/test_metrics_observability.py` — FR-033, FR-058–FR-060, NFR-007.
- [ ] T023 Run `.specify/scripts/bash/check-prerequisites.sh --json --require-tasks --include-tasks`, `uv run ruff check`, and the Phase 1–2 pytest targets from `ai_platform_engineering/dynamic_agents/` — all foundational requirements; done when the new contracts pass and the existing suite has no regression.

**Checkpoint**: Provider-neutral contracts and additive data/routes exist, but execution still uses the current runtime.

---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 — Replace Dynamic Agents Without Disruption (P1 MVP)

**Goal**: Execute existing agents through a `deepagents` compatibility adapter without changing clients, stored documents, streams, cache behavior, or rollback.

**Independent Test**: Run the entire unchanged Dynamic Agents suite and frozen black-box fixtures against the compatibility adapter with existing data and no harness backfill.

- [ ] T024 [P] [US1] Add failing legacy-agent, cache, restart, and rollback tests in `ai_platform_engineering/dynamic_agents/tests/conformance/test_deepagents_compatibility.py` — FR-004–FR-007.

- [ ] T031 [US1] Route start/invoke/resume/cancel/restart through the coordinator in `ai_platform_engineering/dynamic_agents/src/dynamic_agents/routes/chat.py` and provider-neutral interrupt operations in `ai_platform_engineering/dynamic_agents/src/dynamic_agents/routes/conversations.py` — FR-001–FR-003, FR-017–FR-018.
- [ ] T032 [US1] Preserve absent-harness read behavior in `ai_platform_engineering/dynamic_agents/src/dynamic_agents/services/mongo.py` without writing a backfill — FR-004–FR-005; done when reads resolve `deepagents` and stored BSON remains unchanged.
- [ ] T033 [US1] Add an explicit `in_process` compatibility/rollback switch in `ai_platform_engineering/dynamic_agents/src/dynamic_agents/config.py` and `charts/ai-platform-engineering/charts/dynamic-agents/values.yaml` — FR-006, FR-041; done when rollback changes execution mode without data migration.
- [ ] T034 [US1] Run the unchanged Dynamic Agents pytest suite plus contract and conformance suites from `ai_platform_engineering/dynamic_agents/` — SC-001, SC-002, SC-004; done with zero removed or weakened assertions.
- [ ] T035 [US1] Run `ai_platform_engineering/dynamic_agents/tests/performance/benchmark_compatibility.py` against baseline and adapter — NFR-001, NFR-002, NFR-005; done when p95 and memory gates pass.

**Checkpoint**: This is the first releasable MVP. Only Deep Agents is enabled, and external behavior is unchanged.

---

## Phase 4: User Story 4 — Add a Harness Without Rebuilding the Platform (P2)

**Goal**: Make adapter certification repeatable without changing common routes, persistence, security, or encoders.

**Independent Test**: Register a neutral fake adapter, run the conformance kit, then remove it without editing shared request routing or client code.

- [ ] T039 [P] [US4] Add tool, file, skill, subagent, interrupt, cancellation, and error conformance fixtures in `ai_platform_engineering/dynamic_agents/tests/conformance/` — FR-018–FR-025, FR-031–FR-032.
- [ ] T040 [US4] Add a registry-only fake adapter in `ai_platform_engineering/dynamic_agents/src/dynamic_agents/services/harnesses/testing_adapter.py` gated to tests — FR-030; done when add/remove requires registry configuration only.
- [ ] T041 [US4] Implement evidence-derived certification calculation in `ai_platform_engineering/dynamic_agents/src/dynamic_agents/services/harnesses/capability.py` — FR-010–FR-011; done when adapters cannot self-declare `certified`.

- [ ] T043 [US4] Document the adapter authoring and certification workflow in `ai_platform_engineering/dynamic_agents/README.md` — FR-030–FR-032; done when a developer can add the fake adapter using only the published contract.

**Checkpoint**: A new adapter is bounded by contracts and evidence, not changes throughout the platform.

---

## Phase 5: User Story 3 — Same Chat Experience Across Harnesses (P1)

**Goal**: Centralize tools, delegation, approvals, skills, files, and policy so every adapter produces the existing client experience.

- [ ] T051 [US3] Route Deep Agents tools and delegation through the common brokers in `ai_platform_engineering/dynamic_agents/src/dynamic_agents/services/harnesses/deepagents_adapter.py` — FR-019–FR-022; done when existing credential and workflow delegation tests remain unchanged.
- [ ] T052 [US3] Apply canonical size/order/sanitization bounds before wire encoding in `ai_platform_engineering/dynamic_agents/src/dynamic_agents/services/harnesses/events.py` — FR-028–FR-029, NFR-007.

- [ ] T054 [US3] Run all portable conformance cases against `deepagents` and the fake adapter — SC-003, SC-005; done when normalized lifecycle and policy outcomes match.
- [ ] T055 [US3] Update `ai_platform_engineering/dynamic_agents/SSE_EVENTS.md` with canonical-to-existing-wire ownership while preserving the documented client contract — FR-002, FR-026–FR-029.

**Checkpoint**: Portable behavior is enforced by the engine and proven on two implementations.

---

## Phase 6: User Story 7 — Preserve Threads, Memory, and Traces (P1)

**Goal**: Make pods disposable without losing thread continuity, governed cross-thread memory, or causal observability.

**Independent Test**: Persist thread and user memory, replace worker/control-plane replicas, resume exactly, and verify one sanitized trace across every boundary.

- [ ] T056 [P] [US7] Add native-codec, durable-head, idempotency, interrupt-revision, restore-ownership, and uncertain-durability tests in `ai_platform_engineering/dynamic_agents/tests/conformance/test_thread_state.py` — FR-051–FR-054, NFR-011.

**Checkpoint**: External durable state, governed memory, and sanitized causal traces are ready for disposable workers.

---

## Phase 7: User Story 6 — Unique Sandbox Pods for Local Harness Sessions (P1)

**Goal**: Run each local harness conversation epoch in its own claim-exclusive Agent Sandbox pod with no raw credentials and generation fencing.

**Checkpoint**: Operators can distinguish and contain every harness without inspecting sensitive content.

---

## Phase 11: Rollout, Hardening, and Release Gates

**Purpose**: Prove the complete design, rehearse rollback, and update living documentation before production cutover.

- [ ] T125 [P] Run `uv run ruff check` and the entire unchanged plus new pytest suite from `ai_platform_engineering/dynamic_agents/` — FR-007, NFR-004; done with no weakened tests and at least 80% new-code coverage/100% contract-state and security-decision coverage.

- [ ] T129 Run `ai_platform_engineering/dynamic_agents/tests/security/` for authorization-before-provider, sandbox escape, credential canaries, cross-binding access, malformed events/context, SSRF, and telemetry leakage — NFR-003, NFR-007, NFR-009–NFR-010, SC-010–SC-017.
- [ ] T130 Rehearse migration/index creation, rolling upgrade, in-process rollback, Dynamic Agents image rollback, and additive-data readability using `docs/docs/specs/2026-08-17-harness-engine/mongodb-migration.md` and `quickstart.md` — SC-002, SC-008.
- [ ] T131 Implement and run shadow/canary controls in `ai_platform_engineering/dynamic_agents/src/dynamic_agents/config.py` and `charts/ai-platform-engineering/charts/dynamic-agents/values.yaml`, halting rollout on any compatibility/SLO gate — FR-036–FR-037, SC-001, SC-006.
- [ ] T132 [P] Update evidence links and every adapter status in `docs/docs/specs/2026-08-17-harness-engine/compatibility-matrix.md` — FR-011; no `planned` row may be called certified.
- [ ] T133 [P] Update `ai_platform_engineering/dynamic_agents/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `ui/src/components/dynamic-agents/ARCHITECTURE.md`, root `AGENTS.md`, and `.specify/CHANGELOG.md` to reflect the implemented boundaries — documentation constitution gate.
- [ ] T134 Execute every scenario in `docs/docs/specs/2026-08-17-harness-engine/quickstart.md` and record commands/results in the release PR — all success criteria.
- [ ] T135 Audit `docs/docs/specs/2026-08-17-harness-engine/compatibility-matrix.md` and confirm no service alias, public route, wire contract, existing collection, legacy field, or rollback artifact is removed; defer renaming/deletion to a separate spec — FR-001–FR-007, SC-004, SC-008.

**Final checkpoint**: Harness Engine can replace Dynamic Agents under the existing address, with Deep Agents compatibility proven, local sessions isolated, state/memory/traces durable and governed, optional adapters independently certified, UI creation safe, and rollback rehearsed.

## Dependencies and Execution Order

### Phase dependencies

```

- Phase 1 has no implementation dependency and must finish before runtime refactoring.
- Phase 2 blocks all user stories.
- US1 and US4 may begin in parallel after Phase 2, but portable-policy extraction requires both.
- US7 precedes US6 because disposable pods require external durable state and trace boundaries.
- US2 requires the worker/conformance paths from US4, US6, and US7.
- US8 type/catalog/BFF tasks can start after Phase 2; final per-harness UI/E2E certification waits for US2.
- US5 requires real worker and adapter signals from US6/US2.
- Phase 11 waits for every story selected for the release.

### Critical path

`T001–T023 → T024–T035 → T044–T055 → T056–T070 → T071–T084 → T085–T097 → T114–T116 → T125–T135`

### Safe parallel workstreams

- Contract snapshots, performance baseline, and supply-chain research: T001, T002, T004, T006.
- Canonical events, adapter protocols, registry tests, and persistence tests: T008, T010, T012, T014, T016, T018, T021, T022.
- Thread state, memory, and tracing test-first work: T056, T057, T058.
- Chart profiles/security and worker images: T078, T079, T080, T081 after protocol/profile contracts are stable.
- Adapter tests: T085, T086, T087; adapter implementations remain isolated by file.
- UI hooks/components: T105–T113 after shared types and BFF response contracts are stable.
- Final Python, UI, and deployment validation: T125, T126, T127.

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP: compatibility adapter only

1. Complete Phases 1 and 2.
2. Complete US1 through T035.
3. Ship behind the existing service alias with `deepagents` only and `in_process` rollback retained.
4. Stop and verify SC-001, SC-002, SC-004, and SC-006 before adding execution-plane risk.

### Incremental delivery

1. **Compatibility**: Deep Agents adapter and canonical events with no wire/data change.
2. **Portable policy**: Common tools, subagents, interrupts, inputs, state, memory, and tracing.
3. **Isolation**: Deep Agents in claim-exclusive sandbox pods.
4. **Harness expansion**: Claude SDK, Strands, and AgentCore land disabled/experimental and certify independently.
5. **Builder and operations**: Harness-aware editor, health, capacity, dashboards, and rollout controls.
6. **Replacement**: Canary, soak, rollback rehearsal, then production cutover under the existing alias.

## Completion Rules

- Write and observe each listed test fail before implementing its behavior.
- Do not mark an adapter `certified` until every applicable compatibility-matrix row links to passing evidence.
- Do not enable automatic fallback after a run may have produced output or side effects.
- Do not run a production local harness in-process after its sandbox profile is certified.
- Do not expose credentials, raw identities, arbitrary images/Kubernetes resources, or protected content to workers, agent configuration, UI, telemetry, or provider session IDs.
- Do not acknowledge durable completion before native state and the binding head are committed.
- Do not persist parked UI options, browser capability claims, or stale validation results.
- Preserve the original Dynamic Agents rollback path until Phase 11 completes.

## Phase 12: Independent Portable Abstraction Slice (Implemented)

This phase supersedes the earlier AgentCore-only overlay. It intentionally does
not complete or modify tasks targeting `ai_platform_engineering/dynamic_agents/`.

- [x] T136 Define provider-neutral `AgentBlueprint`, `HarnessDescriptor`, capability levels, validation results, sessions, runs, and canonical events in `ai_platform_engineering/harness_engine/src/harness_engine/models.py`.
- [x] T137 Define broker boundaries for thread state, memory, tools, sandboxes, prompts, delegation, and telemetry in `ai_platform_engineering/harness_engine/src/harness_engine/brokers.py`.
- [x] T138 Implement the registry, catalog revision, normalized fingerprint, profile validation, and required-capability rejection in `ai_platform_engineering/harness_engine/src/harness_engine/registry.py`.
- [x] T139 Refactor AgentCore to the portable adapter contract with operator profiles, native session persistence, sanitized descriptor, and canonical events.
- [x] T140 Add a Claude Agent SDK adapter with operator profiles, safe option schema, native SDK session resume, text/usage translation, and injected-query tests.
- [x] T141 Replace overlay persistence with independent immutable agent versions, durable session bindings, runs, and replay events in memory and Mongo repositories.
- [x] T142 Refactor run coordination to pin sessions to agent versions, compile prompts, own provider tasks after disconnect, update native session IDs, and sanitize failures.
- [x] T143 Add catalog, draft validation, full agent save/get, detached run, replay, and cancellation APIs without importing or editing Dynamic Agents.
- [x] T144 Refactor the CAIPE editor and BFF to consume descriptors, render primitive JSON-Schema options, validate drafts server-side, and save independent blueprints.
- [x] T145 Add AgentCore, Claude SDK, immutable-version/session, ownership, disconnect/replay, schema-driven UI, and BFF tests.
- [x] T146 Document the portable contracts, session/thread/memory model, sandbox-pod target, UI contract, current limitations, and research in `portable-abstractions.md` and the component README.
- [ ] T147 Move Harness Engine validation before the legacy Dynamic Agents write and provide atomic/recoverable dual-save coordination.
- [ ] T148 Implement claim-exclusive Agent Sandbox pods, worker fencing, external checkpoint state, and tool/memory broker capability tokens for local SDK harnesses.
- [x] T149 Implement `CAIPEAgentSessionManager` for binding identity, ownership, immutable version pinning, durable lookup, provider event persistence, clear, and epoch rotation.
- [x] T150 Implement the provider-specific `ProviderSessionManager` contract and AgentCore deterministic plus Claude event-assigned strategies.
- [x] T151 Add authorized session-clear API/BFF routes and tests proving active-run cancellation, owner isolation, provider close, new binding identity, and adoption of the current agent version after clear.
