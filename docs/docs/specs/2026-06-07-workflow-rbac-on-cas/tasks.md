# Tasks: Workflow RBAC on CAS (re-implementation of #1751)

**Date:** 2026-06-07
**Stacked on:** PR #1770 (CAS foundation) — branch `feat/centralized-authz-service`
**Supersedes:** PR #1751
**Companions:** [`../2026-06-06-cas-implementation/spec.md`](../2026-06-06-cas-implementation/spec.md) · [`architecture.md`](../2026-06-06-cas-implementation/architecture.md) · [`research.md`](../2026-06-06-cas-implementation/research.md)

## Goal

Re-implement #1751 (workflow RBAC: visibility, run access, team sharing, execution authz, editor UX) on top of CAS — and resolve the #1751 review feedback.

## Status — 2026-06-07

Implemented on local branch `feat/workflow-rbac-on-cas` (to be split → #1770 CAS core + #1771 workflow).

- **Phase 1 (PAP)** — `PolicyAdmin` + grant/revoke shipped in CAS core; grants exposed at `/api/admin/authz/grants` (admin-gated + meta-authz "caller manages the resource"), `cas_grant` audit. *Path differs from the planned `/api/authz/v1/grants`.*
- **Phase 2 (read/use)** — data model from the #1751 merge; `workflow-runs` (read/delete/start) and `workflow-configs` **read-path** re-pointed onto CAS via `filterAccessible` + org-admin bypass. ⚠️ **PUT/DELETE configs stay on the owner/visibility model** — CAS write/delete grants aren't modeled yet.
- **Phase 3 (per-step gate)** — `authorize(user, step.agent_id, use)` runs in the shared `executeSteps()` loop (covers start **and** resume); DENY fails the step. Tested.
- **Phase 4 (DA)** — `workflow_execution_authz.py` deleted; DA agrees with CAS via a **mirrored org-admin bypass** in `openfga_authz.py` (⚠️ kept its own OpenFGA check rather than calling CAS over HTTP). Tested.
- **Phase 6 (editor UX)** — landed via the #1751 merge.
- **Phase 7** — `domains/workflow.ts` stub dropped; Access Manager/Diagnostics dead code removed; missing tests added (Phase 3/4 + bearer fallback).

**Remaining:** Phase 5 (modal → grant API, cosmetic); split branch → PRs #1770/#1771 + DCO sign-off; reply to #1751 threads.

## Addresses #1751 review comments

| Comment | Resolution here |
|---|---|
| **@subbaksh** on `workflow_execution_authz.py` — *"Workflows are a UI-server concept; RBAC for invocation should be in the UI server, not DA."* | Per-step agent-use gate moves into the BFF `executeSteps()`; **`workflow_execution_authz.py` is deleted**. DA reads no `workflow_configs`. |
| **@subbaksh** on `workflow-da-auth.ts` — *"Why send user/email in a header and have DA trust it?"* | Workflow authz no longer depends on `X-User-Context`. Header survives only for `get_user_context()` email; cleanup tracked in **#1753**. |
| **code-quality bot** — unused import in `workflow-run-access.ts` | File is replaced by CAS `authorize` / `filterAccessible`. |

## Architecture note

The BFF `executeSteps()` **orchestrates the workflow and invokes agents one step at a time** (`/api/v1/chat/stream/start` per step). So the per-step CAS gate runs **in-process in the BFF** — no DA→CAS cross-process delegation, no decision tokens, no shared run registry. Direct agent chat still migrates DA's `openfga_authz.py` → CAS HTTP check.

## Decisions (locked)

- **Standing grants** — sharing writes `team→agent` tuples; global workflows write a `user:* can_use agent` wildcard.
- **CAS owns grants** via an intent-based PAP (`PolicyAdmin`); meta-authz: caller must **manage the agent** being granted.
- **Full #1751 parity** (including editor UX).
- **Drop** the `domains/workflow.ts` delegation stub.

## Phases

### Phase 1 — CAS grant API (PAP)
- [ ] `PolicyAdmin` interface + `OpenFgaPolicyAdmin` (tuple write/delete transport)
- [ ] `grant()` / `revoke()` in `lib/authz`; `GrantIntent` contract type
- [ ] `POST` / `DELETE /api/authz/v1/grants` — JWKS verify + meta-authz (caller manages resource)
- [ ] `cas_grant` audit event
- [ ] unit + contract tests

### Phase 2 — Workflow data model + BFF read/use
- [x] `visibility` / `shared_with_teams` / `owner_id` on workflow config (via #1751 merge)
- [x] `workflow-configs` **read-path** → CAS; runs read/delete/start → CAS *(PUT/DELETE configs stay on owner/visibility)*
- [x] list filtering via `filterAccessible`

### Phase 3 — BFF per-step execution gate (addresses @subbaksh #3)
- [x] `authorize({user, step.agent_id, use})` in `executeSteps()` before `chat/stream/start`
- [x] same gate covers resume (shared `executeSteps()` loop)
- [x] DENY → fail step with a clean reason; audit

### Phase 4 — DA cleanup (addresses @subbaksh #3 + #2)
- [x] delete `workflow_execution_authz.py` + its test
- [x] `openfga_authz.py`: mirrored org-admin bypass so DA agrees with CAS *(kept DA's own OpenFGA check; no CAS HTTP call)*
- [ ] `X-User-Context` reduced to email-only; link #1753

### Phase 5 — Share / modal via CAS grant API
- [ ] `WorkflowAgentAccessModal` → `POST /api/authz/v1/grants` (team→agent, global→`user:*`)
- [ ] remove direct OpenFGA admin writes from the modal path

### Phase 6 — Editor UX parity
- [ ] unsaved-changes badge + discard dialog
- [ ] `WorkflowCanvas` / `WorkflowSidebar` / `WorkflowStepSidebar` / `WorkflowToolbar`

### Phase 7 — Cleanup + verify
- [x] drop `domains/workflow.ts` stub
- [x] fix unused import (bot comment) + remove Access Manager/Diagnostics dead code
- [x] Phase 3/4 + bearer-fallback tests added; targeted suites green *(full-suite coverage pass pending)*
- [ ] reply to #1751 threads; mark #1751 superseded by this PR
