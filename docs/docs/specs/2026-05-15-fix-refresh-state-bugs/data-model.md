# Phase 1 — Data Model & Invariants

**Feature**: `2026-05-15-fix-refresh-state-bugs`
**Date**: 2026-05-15

This feature does not introduce new persisted entities. It tightens the invariants of two existing in-memory shapes (`ChatState.conversations` and `ChatContainer`'s derived `readOnlyReason`) and one server-side return value (`requireConversationAccess.access_level`).

## In-Memory: `ChatState.conversations` (Zustand store)

**Type**: `Conversation[]` (see `ui/src/types/a2a.ts` for the `Conversation` type)

### Existing fields (unchanged)

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | `string` (UUID) | Canonical conversation identifier. For autonomous tasks, `task.chat_conversation_id ?? uuidv5("task:<task.id>", AUTONOMOUS_NS)`. |
| `title` | `string` | |
| `createdAt` / `updatedAt` | `Date` | |
| `messages` | `ChatMessage[]` | |
| `a2aEvents` | `A2AEvent[]` | Not persisted. |
| `streamEvents` | `StreamEvent[]` | Not persisted. |
| `participants` | `Participant[]` | |
| `owner_id` | `string?` | Server-provided when present; missing on synthesized autonomous entries. |
| `sharing` | `Conversation['sharing']?` | |
| `source` | `'web' \| 'slack' \| 'autonomous' \| undefined` | Set by the loader that produced the entry. |
| `task_id`, `run_id` | `string?` | Autonomous metadata. |

### Invariants enforced by this feature

- **Inv-A — Uniqueness by id**: For all `i ≠ j`, `conversations[i].id !== conversations[j].id`. No two sidebar entries may share an id, regardless of `source`. Enforced at **three** sites so the invariant holds in every storage mode and even when no network call has run yet:
  1. **`onRehydrateStorage`** (Zustand `persist`, `localStorage` mode only) — runs synchronously when the store is first hydrated from `localStorage`. Defensive guards FIRST: short-circuit if `state` is null/missing `conversations`; skip any entry with a non-string or empty `id`. Then Map-based dedupe-by-id keyed on `Conversation.id`. **Winner selection on collision (deterministic, NaN-safe; finding N5 in `/speckit.analyze` re-run)**:
     a. If exactly one of the two has `source === 'autonomous'`, that one wins (consistent with Inv-B).
     b. Otherwise prefer the entry with more `messages.length`.
     c. Otherwise prefer the entry whose `updatedAt` parses to a **finite, valid** epoch number — i.e., `Number.isFinite(new Date(updatedAt).getTime())` MUST be true. If exactly one entry has a valid `updatedAt`, that one wins. (Defends against legacy persisted entries with missing/null/malformed `updatedAt`, which would otherwise produce `NaN` and make `<` and `>` both return `false`, leading to non-deterministic Map insertion-order winners.)
     d. Otherwise (both have valid `updatedAt`) prefer the entry with the most-recent `new Date(updatedAt).getTime()`.
     e. Otherwise (final last-resort tiebreak — both invalid `updatedAt`) prefer the entry whose `id` sorts first lexicographically. Strictly deterministic so two runs over the same persisted state produce identical winners.

     **After winner selection, merge messages from BOTH entries by `message.id`** (winner's messages first, then the loser's whose id is not already present), then sort the merged list by `timestamp` ascending and assign to the surviving entry's `messages`. The same NaN-safety applies to message timestamps: messages with non-finite timestamps sort to the END of the merged list (treat `NaN` as `+Infinity`) so they don't disrupt the chronological ordering of well-formed messages. This guarantees no user-typed message is lost to the source-preference contest.
  2. **`loadConversationsFromServer`** — runs after the conversations API call returns. Map-based dedupe-by-id over `[...serverConversations, ...localOnlyPreserved]`. Insertion semantics: **server-wins-on-collision**. Server entries are inserted first; each local-only-preserved entry is inserted **only if its `id` is not already present in the Map** (i.e. the second pass does NOT overwrite an existing server entry, because the server is authoritative for `source` and metadata). Concretely: `for (const c of localOnlyPreserved) if (!map.has(c.id)) map.set(c.id, c);`. In practice no collision occurs at this site because the upstream `localOnlyPreserved` filter already excludes any id present in `serverConversations`; the dedupe is defense in depth against a future refactor that drops that filter.
  3. **`loadAutonomousConversationsFromService`** — runs after the autonomous-agents service call returns. Map-based dedupe-by-id over `[...others, ...merged]`. Autonomous synth entries override on collision (consistent with Inv-B). The existing per-message merge inside `merged.map(...)` (chat-store.ts L1157–L1161) preserves user-typed messages by `message.id`; the dedupe must not bypass it.

  Sites (1) and (3) together close the back-to-back-refresh edge case: even if the user mashes F5 before any network loader completes, rehydrate is self-healing on its own. Site (3) also handles the `autonomousAgentsEnabled = false` early-return: the early return MUST also pass surviving conversations through the same dedupe (any pre-existing `source: undefined` collision is healed at rehydrate; the early return only filters `source === 'autonomous'` rows and does not need its own dedupe pass).
- **Inv-B — Source resolution on collision**: When two paths produce an entry with the same `id`, the autonomous-synthesized copy wins for the `source` label and the canonical messages list. User-typed messages from the surviving non-autonomous copy are merged in by `message.id` (the existing autonomous merge already does this; the dedupe must not bypass it).
- **Inv-E — Persistence scope**: The Zustand `partialize` output MUST NOT carry any authorization, session, or admin-origin signals into client storage. The denylist is split into two scopes because the persisted shape contains nested objects (notably `ChatMessage`) that legitimately use the generic field name `role` for their own (non-authorization) purpose:

  | Scope | Denylist (canonical list — kept in sync with T013 + T013a) | Rationale |
  |---|---|---|
  | **Top-level keys** of the `partialize` output (i.e. direct properties of the root object Zustand persists, AND direct properties of each `Conversation` object inside `conversations[]`) | `access_level`, `accessLevel`, `readOnlyReason`, `readOnly`, `adminOrigin`, `isAdmin`, `canViewAdmin`, `sessionRole`, `authRole`, `role`, `userRole` (11 entries) | These are session/authorization labels. They MUST NOT be persisted at the conversation or root level. No legitimate `Conversation` field uses any of these names — including `role`, which is not a `Conversation` property. |
  | **Recursive (any nesting depth)** | `access_level`, `accessLevel`, `readOnlyReason`, `readOnly`, `adminOrigin`, `isAdmin`, `canViewAdmin`, `sessionRole`, `authRole`, `userRole` (10 entries — `TOP_LEVEL_DENYLIST` minus the single `role` exception) | These names have no legitimate use anywhere in the persisted shape at any depth. `readOnly` (boolean ChatPanel prop), `userRole` (disambiguated session/auth label), and the underscore/camel-cased server names all stay out at every level. |

  **The `role` exception is the ONLY recursive-denylist omission, and it has a hard-coded justification**: `ChatMessage.role: 'user' \| 'assistant' \| 'system'` is the canonical message-sender field and appears on every persisted message. Including bare `role` in the recursive denylist would break every persisted conversation by stripping the message-sender label. Any future need to persist an authorization role MUST use one of the explicitly-denylisted disambiguated names (`sessionRole`, `authRole`, or `userRole`) — never bare `role`. This is the contract that makes the split denylist sound.

  No other key is recursively-omitted. In particular, `readOnly` is in BOTH scopes (it has no legitimate use as a persisted field — it is a `ChatPanel` prop, computed per-render, and would be a category-error to store on a `Conversation` or `ChatMessage`); same for `userRole`. The earlier draft of this table omitted `readOnly` and `userRole` from recursive without rationale; that omission was a documentation oversight (finding A3 in the latest `/speckit.analyze`) and is corrected here.

  The currently persisted shape (conversations with empty `a2aEvents`/`streamEvents` and trimmed messages) is correct and remains unchanged. The enforcing test (T013) parses the `partialize` output as JSON and walks the object tree, applying the **top-level** denylist to root + each `Conversation` and the **recursive** denylist to every nested object. The implementation in T013a explicitly strips both denylists from every spread (so even if a future setter writes one of these keys onto store state, `partialize` removes it before persist). Substring search on serialized JSON is insufficient and forbidden by the test — conversation titles and message bodies can legitimately contain denylisted substrings.

### State transitions (refresh sequence)

```text
mount
  ├─ Zustand persist rehydrates `conversations` from localStorage (localStorage mode)
  │    or starts empty (MongoDB mode).
  │    └─ NEW: dedupe-by-id pass inside onRehydrateStorage; autonomous-source wins
  │       on collision; ties broken by message count then updatedAt. Heals any
  │       duplicate persisted before this fix shipped, BEFORE any network call,
  │       so the sidebar is correct on the very first paint and survives
  │       back-to-back F5 refreshes.
  ├─ `loadConversationsFromServer()` fetches MongoDB-backed conversations.
  │    └─ Merges with `streamingConversations` + `activeConversationId` preservation.
  │    └─ NEW: final dedupe-by-id pass.
  └─ `loadAutonomousConversationsFromService()` synthesizes autonomous entries.
       └─ Existing per-message merge for autonomous-tagged entries.
       └─ NEW: final dedupe-by-id pass; autonomous-synth wins on collision.
```

End-state guarantee: regardless of order of completion, regardless of storage mode, regardless of whether the autonomous service is enabled, and regardless of how many times the user refreshes in rapid succession, every `id` appears at most once.

### Back-to-back-refresh resilience

The rehydrate-time dedupe (site 1) is critical for the "F5 twice in a row" path. Without it, a user with poisoned `localStorage` (a duplicate persisted before this fix shipped) sees the duplicate on every refresh until *both* of these complete in a single uninterrupted session: (a) `loadAutonomousConversationsFromService` finishes its async work and applies `set(...)`, and (b) Zustand's `partialize` writes the deduped state back to `localStorage`. If the user refreshes before either of those, the original duplicated `localStorage` is rehydrated again. With site (1) in place, the rehydrate path is self-healing on its own — no network call required.

### Concurrency: same-loader and cross-loader (finding N1 in `/speckit.analyze` re-run)

`loadConversationsFromServer` already has a module-level `isLoadingConversations` guard (`chat-store.ts` L883–L886) that short-circuits a second concurrent invocation. `loadAutonomousConversationsFromService` does NOT have an equivalent guard, but a guard is not strictly required for correctness because the Map-based dedupe inside each call is idempotent on its own snapshot — two concurrent invocations of the same autonomous loader still produce a duplicate-free final state. The behaviour worth pinning is the **cross-loader** case where `loadConversationsFromServer` and `loadAutonomousConversationsFromService` interleave. Today (chat-store.ts L1018):

```ts
// loadConversationsFromServer (imperative form):
set({ conversations: sortedConversations });   // overwrites with snapshot built at L954
```

```ts
// loadAutonomousConversationsFromService (callback form):
set((state) => { ... return { conversations: final }; });   // reads latest state
```

If autonomous's callback `set(...)` runs **between** server's snapshot read (L954) and server's imperative `set(...)` (L1018), autonomous's update is silently overwritten. The Map-based dedupe inside the server loader operates on the L954 snapshot, which does not contain autonomous's freshly-written entries.

**Inv-G — Cross-loader merge safety**: When two loaders write to `conversations` concurrently, neither write may discard the other's contribution. Implementations satisfy this by:

1. Converting `loadConversationsFromServer`'s `set(...)` to the **callback form** `set((state) => ({ conversations: dedupeById([...sortedConversations, ...state.conversations.filter(c => shouldKeepFromOther(c))]) }))`, where `shouldKeepFromOther` keeps any entry that the server snapshot would not have known about (notably autonomous-source entries written by the other loader between snapshot-read and write); OR
2. A single shared mutex (`isLoadingConversationsOrAutonomous`) that serializes BOTH loaders so their reads and writes cannot interleave.

Option (1) is preferred: it preserves parallel I/O latency. Option (2) is acceptable as a fallback if option (1) proves intricate. Tested by T015c.

## In-Memory: `ChatContainer` derived state

**Source file**: `ui/src/components/chat/ChatContainer.tsx`

### Existing inputs

| Input | Source | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `accessLevel` | API response `access_level` (or `null` if not provided) | Server-side authorization label. |
| `adminOrigin` | `useSearchParams().get('from')` | One of `'audit-logs'`, `'feedback'`, or `null`. |

### Existing derivation (today, BUGGY)

```ts
const isReadOnly = accessLevel === 'admin_audit' || accessLevel === 'shared_readonly';
const readOnlyReason =
  accessLevel === 'admin_audit' ? 'admin_audit'
  : accessLevel === 'shared_readonly' ? 'shared_readonly'
  : undefined;
```

### New derivation (post-fix)

```ts
// admin_audit is only honored as an in-session audit context when the user
// actually navigated from the admin audit-logs or feedback views (Inv-C).
// The closed set {'audit-logs', 'feedback'} is the ONLY set of values
// honoured; any other value (including e.g. 'shared-link', 'whatever',
// or empty string) is treated identically to ?from= being absent.
const adminAuditActive = accessLevel === 'admin_audit'
  && (adminOrigin === 'audit-logs' || adminOrigin === 'feedback');

// Inv-C2: when the server returns admin_audit but the gate evaluates
// false (no ?from=, or unrecognized ?from=), the user has no write
// access at the server but the composer would render. Route this case
// through the EXISTING shared_readonly UI treatment so the user sees a
// clear read-only banner instead of a silent send-failure. We do NOT
// introduce a new readOnlyReason value for this case; reusing
// 'shared_readonly' keeps the prop-type union and ChatPanel rendering
// branches unchanged. FR-005 still holds because non-admin users
// cannot reach access_level === 'admin_audit' server-side, so this
// fallback branch is unreachable for non-admins.
const isReadOnly =
  adminAuditActive
  || accessLevel === 'admin_audit'      // server says read-only; gate failed → SR fallback
  || accessLevel === 'shared_readonly';
const readOnlyReason =
  adminAuditActive ? 'admin_audit'
  : (accessLevel === 'admin_audit' || accessLevel === 'shared_readonly') ? 'shared_readonly'
  : undefined;
```

### Invariant enforced

- **Inv-C — Audit banner gating**: The UI MAY render `readOnlyReason === 'admin_audit'` only when both (a) the API returned `access_level === 'admin_audit'`, and (b) `adminOrigin` is `'audit-logs'` or `'feedback'` (the closed honoured set; any other value is treated identically to `adminOrigin` being `null`).
- **Inv-C2 — No silent write-fail via `shared_readonly` fallback (finding N3 in `/speckit.analyze` re-run; option A per design discussion)**: When the server returns `access_level === 'admin_audit'` but the Inv-C gate evaluates false (no `?from=`, or unrecognized `?from=` value), the UI MUST render the **existing `shared_readonly` read-only treatment** (`readOnlyReason === 'shared_readonly'`, composer hidden, standard sharing banner). The UI MUST NOT render the "Read-Only Audit Mode" heading and MUST NOT render the "Back to Audit Logs / Feedback" admin back-link for this case. Justification: the API rejects writes for any `admin_audit` user regardless of URL state; routing through the existing `shared_readonly` UI branch gives the user a clear read-only treatment without leaking admin-only UI chrome and without introducing a new `readOnlyReason` value. FR-005 still holds because non-admin users cannot reach `access_level === 'admin_audit'` server-side.

### Where the gate runs (and where it doesn't) — finding N2 in `/speckit.analyze` re-run

`ChatContainer.tsx` has TWO paths that populate `accessLevel`:

1. **Local-store hit** (L130–L143). Used on the common refresh path when the conversation already exists in `useChatStore.conversations` (rehydrated from `localStorage` or fetched by a prior loader). This path derives `accessLevel` from `localConv.owner_id + localConv.sharing.*` only. It NEVER sets `accessLevel = 'admin_audit'`, because the persisted store does not (and per Inv-E MUST not) carry session/admin signals. For an admin viewing a non-owned non-shared conversation, `accessLevel` stays at `null` until `loadMessagesFromServer` / `loadTurnsFromServer` round-trips and `setAccessLevel` is called from the API response (handled implicitly by the messages loader in some code paths, or by the API-fallback path described next).
2. **API roundtrip** (L196–L218). Used on a deep-link refresh when the conversation is NOT in the local store. Calls `apiClient.getConversation(uuid)`, reads `(conv as any).access_level`, and sets `accessLevel` to that value. This is the path where the server can return `'admin_audit'`, and therefore the path where the Inv-C gate (T026) actually has work to do.

**Implication for testing**: T022, T029, T029a all exercise path (2) by mocking the conversation API. They do NOT — and should not — assert behaviour on path (1), because path (1) cannot produce `accessLevel === 'admin_audit'` in the first place. This is intentional and is the reason Bug #2 is reproducible primarily on deep-link refreshes (URL → API path) rather than on sidebar-click navigation (already-in-store path).

**Implication for the fix**: T026's gate is narrowly scoped to path (2). Path (1) is already safe by construction — it cannot mis-classify a conversation as `'admin_audit'` because it never assigns that value. Reviewers should not expect T026 to "do anything" on the local-store-hit path; the lack of effect there is correct.

This is a deliberate scope decision: fixing path (1) to ALSO produce `accessLevel === 'admin_audit'` for admins on non-owned non-shared conversations would be a feature expansion (admin-audit awareness on sidebar-click), not a bug fix, and is out of scope for this spec.

### Cross-conversation `?from=` carry-over

`adminOrigin` is read from `useSearchParams().get('from')` on every render — it is a per-page-load signal sourced from the live URL, never restored from `localStorage`. This means it follows whatever the URL currently says, which has two implications worth calling out (finding C5 in `/speckit.analyze`; spec FR-004 clarification 1 codifies the design choice):

1. **Refresh on the same audit URL is honored.** If the admin lands on `/chat/<uuid>?from=audit-logs` via the audit-logs view and refreshes, the URL still contains `?from=audit-logs` and the banner remains. This is intentional and matches FR-004 acceptance scenario 3.
2. **Cross-conversation carry-over via the URL is honored too.** If the admin is on `/chat/<A>?from=audit-logs` (legitimate audit) and then types `/chat/<B>?from=audit-logs` into the address bar (or follows a sidebar link that preserves all current search params, depending on how the link is constructed), the banner shows on B as well — provided the server independently returns `access_level === 'admin_audit'` for B (i.e., B is non-owned, non-shared, and the admin is browsing it). This is by design: the `?from=` query string is the source of truth for "I am acting as an auditor right now"; if the admin keeps that flag in the URL while moving to another non-owned conversation, they are still acting as an auditor and the banner is correct.
3. **Sidebar links MUST NOT preserve `?from=` when navigating to the user's OWN conversation.** This case is already neutralized by the server: when the admin opens their own conversation, the API returns `access_level === 'owner'`, the gate's first conjunct (`accessLevel === 'admin_audit'`) is false, and the banner does not render — even if `?from=audit-logs` is left over in the URL. T029 covers this. Out of caution, sidebar code SHOULD strip `?from=` when constructing links to conversations the user owns, but this is a UX nicety, not a correctness requirement.

**Security note**: This gating is **presentation-only**. The server-side `access_level` decision in `requireConversationAccess` is authoritative for authorization. `adminOrigin` is derived from a user-controllable URL search parameter (`?from=...`) and is NEVER trusted to grant, escalate, or modify permissions. Even if a user tampers with the URL to add `?from=audit-logs`, the audit banner only renders when the **server** independently determined `access_level === 'admin_audit'` for that user on that conversation; a non-admin can never reach `admin_audit` server-side, so URL tampering cannot expose admin-only UI.

## Server: `requireConversationAccess` return value

**Source file**: `ui/src/lib/api-middleware.ts`

### Existing return type (unchanged)

```ts
type ConversationAccessLevel = 'owner' | 'shared' | 'shared_readonly' | 'admin_audit';
interface ConversationAccessResult { conversation: any; access_level: ConversationAccessLevel; }
```

### New check order

Reorder the cascade so the `source === 'autonomous'` branch runs **before** the admin fallback:

```text
1. Owner                          → 'owner'
2. sharing.is_public              → 'shared' | 'shared_readonly'
3. sharing.shared_with includes   → 'shared' | 'shared_readonly'
4. Team grant                     → 'shared' | 'shared_readonly'
5. Email-grant subcollection      → 'shared' | 'shared_readonly'
6. NEW POSITION:
   conversation.source === 'autonomous' → 'shared_readonly'
7. session.role === 'admin' || canViewAdmin → 'admin_audit'
8. Else                           → 403
```

### Invariant enforced

- **Inv-D — Autonomous never resolves to admin_audit**: For every conversation with `source === 'autonomous'` and a non-owner user, `requireConversationAccess` returns `access_level === 'shared_readonly'`. Admin status does not change this.

### Backward compatibility

- The `ConversationAccessLevel` union and the API response shape are unchanged. Only the **value** returned for one previously-misclassified case changes (admin + autonomous: was `admin_audit`, now `shared_readonly`).
- Admin auditing of **non-autonomous** conversations the admin does not otherwise have access to is unchanged: step 7 still fires and returns `admin_audit`.
- Write-side endpoints already reject mutations on conversations with `access_level === 'shared_readonly'` for non-owners; behavior for admin + autonomous remains read-only.
- **Non-admin users on autonomous conversations**: behaviour is unchanged by T025. Pre-fix, non-admins fell through step 6 (admin check fails) and landed on step 7 (autonomous → `shared_readonly`). Post-fix, they hit the autonomous branch one step earlier. Same return value, same UI.

## Cross-cutting: read-only-trigger inventory (FR-008)

**Inv-F — All read-only triggers are session/URL/server-derived, never persisted.** This invariant complements Inv-E by enumerating every flag the UI can use to render a read-only treatment, and pinning the trustworthy source for each:

| Read-only trigger | UI surface | Trustworthy source | Persisted in `localStorage`? |
|---|---|---|---|
| `admin_audit` | "Read-Only Audit Mode" banner + admin back-link in `ChatPanel` | (a) `requireConversationAccess` returning `access_level === 'admin_audit'` AND (b) `useSearchParams().get('from') ∈ {'audit-logs','feedback'}` (Inv-C). | **No.** Both the API response and the URL search param are session-scoped. Inv-E denies persistence. |
| `shared_readonly` | "Read-Only" / sharing banner in `ChatPanel` | Multiple equivalent sources, all session/server-derived: (i) `requireConversationAccess` evaluating `sharing.is_public`, `sharing.shared_with`, `shared_with_teams`, `sharing_access` collection, or `source === 'autonomous'` (post-T025) and returning `access_level === 'shared_readonly'`; (ii) per Inv-C2, the admin-without-recognized-origin fallback (server returned `admin_audit` but the Inv-C gate failed) — `ChatContainer` routes this through the same `shared_readonly` UI branch; (iii) `ChatContainer`'s local-store-hit path (L130–L143) derives `shared_readonly` from `localConv.owner_id` + `sharing.*`, but that data came from the most-recent server response and is refreshed by `loadMessagesFromServer` shortly after. | **No** (the `accessLevel` `useState` is session-only; the conversation's `sharing.*` fields ARE persisted, but they are server-authoritative metadata, not client-asserted permission flags). |
| `agent-deleted` (Dynamic Agents) | "Agent deleted" banner / disabled composer | Live `/api/dynamic-agents/agents/{id}` response with HTTP 404. Stored in `ChatContainer`'s `agentNotFound` `useState`. | **No** (`useState`, not persisted). |
| `agent-disabled` (Dynamic Agents) | "Agent disabled" treatment | `agentInfo.enabled === false` from the live `/api/dynamic-agents/agents/{id}` response. Stored in `ChatContainer`'s `agentInfo` `useState`. | **No** (`useState`, not persisted). |

FR-008 persistence-side coverage is enforced end-to-end by **T013** (`partialize` tree-walk in `chat-store.test.ts`), which parses the `partialize` output and fails if any of `accessLevel`, `readOnlyReason`, `adminOrigin`, `isAdmin`, `canViewAdmin`, `sessionRole`, `authRole` (or the underscore-cased server names) ever appear as own-keys at any nesting depth. A separate static `rg` audit for store-setter writes was considered and dropped as redundant — any future code path that wrote one of those flags into a persisted-store setter would surface as a T013 failure on the next test run. `agentNotFound` and `agentInfo` are not in the denylist by name because they live in `ChatContainer` `useState` (never in the store), but the broader principle documented next to `partialize` (T003 comment) makes adding them to the persisted shape a review-time red flag.

**Scope note (finding N8 in `/speckit.analyze` re-run)**: Inv-F covers PERSISTENCE only. It does NOT cover whether `agentInfo` itself contains admin-only or PII fields that get rendered to non-admins. The `agentInfo` payload includes `model.id`, `allowed_tools`, `subagents`, `skills`, `ui.gradient_theme`, etc., and is fetched per-conversation from `/api/dynamic-agents/agents/{id}`. Render-side disclosure of those fields is governed by that API route's existing per-user authorization, NOT by this invariant. If a future security review discovers that the API route over-shares (e.g., returns admin-only `model.id` to non-admin viewers of a publicly-shared dynamic agent), that would be a separate finding against the dynamic-agents API contract, not against Inv-F. This note exists so a reviewer who sees `agentInfo` mentioned in Inv-F's "trustworthy source" column does not conclude "all `agentInfo` security concerns are covered here."

## Test surface

| Invariant | Test file | Assertion |
|---|---|---|
| Inv-A, Inv-B | `ui/src/store/__tests__/chat-store.test.ts` | (a) After both `loadConversationsFromServer` and `loadAutonomousConversationsFromService` complete, no two `conversations` share an id; collisions resolve to the autonomous copy with user-typed messages preserved. (b) The `activeConversationId`, when set, resolves to exactly one entry in `conversations`. (c) **Rehydration test (back-to-back-refresh resilience)**: seed raw `localStorage` for key `caipe-chat-history` with two `conversations[]` entries that share an `id` (one with `source: undefined`, one with `source: 'autonomous'`); construct the store; assert `useChatStore.getState().conversations` contains exactly one entry for that id with `source === 'autonomous'`, before any loader is invoked. |
| Inv-C | `ui/src/components/chat/__tests__/ChatContainer.test.tsx` (or `ChatPanel.test.tsx` with explicit props) | Audit banner renders iff `access_level === 'admin_audit'` AND `adminOrigin ∈ {'audit-logs','feedback'}`. Negative cases: non-admin user, admin without `?from=`, admin with `access_level === 'shared_readonly'`, **owner viewing own conversation with `?from=audit-logs` in URL (audit-context leak test)**. |
| Inv-C2 | `ui/src/components/chat/__tests__/ChatContainer.test.tsx` (T029c) | When `access_level === 'admin_audit'` AND `adminOrigin` is null OR an unrecognized value (`'shared-link'`, `'whatever'`, `''`), the rendered output: (a) does NOT contain "Read-Only Audit Mode"; (b) does NOT contain "Back to Audit Logs" / "Back to Feedback"; (c) hides the composer; (d) is rendered with `readOnlyReason === 'shared_readonly'` (NOT `'admin_audit'`, NOT a new value) — i.e., the case is routed through the existing `shared_readonly` UI branch. |
| Inv-D | `ui/src/app/api/__tests__/admin-audit-access.test.ts` | Admin session + autonomous-source conversation → `access_level === 'shared_readonly'`. Admin session + non-autonomous non-owned conversation → `access_level === 'admin_audit'` (unchanged). |
| Inv-E | `ui/src/store/__tests__/chat-store.test.ts` (dedicated `partialize` test, T013, exercising the T013a defensive strip) | Test **injects** every denylisted key onto the seed state at root, `Conversation`, and `ChatMessage` level (via `as any` casts so the test compiles even when the types do not declare them); then parses the `partialize` output as JSON and walks the object tree asserting (a) the **top-level** denylist (11 entries: `access_level`, `accessLevel`, `readOnlyReason`, `readOnly`, `adminOrigin`, `isAdmin`, `canViewAdmin`, `sessionRole`, `authRole`, `role`, `userRole`) is absent at the root and on every `Conversation` object's own keys, and (b) the **recursive** denylist (10 entries — `TOP_LEVEL_DENYLIST` minus the single `role` exception; see the Inv-E table above) is absent at every nesting depth. The bare `role` key is the only exemption from the recursive check because `ChatMessage.role` is a non-authorization sender field. Inline code comment near `partialize` documents this constraint; T013a's `stripDenylistedKeys` helper is the runtime enforcement that makes T013 green. |
| **Write-path coverage (defense in depth)** | Codebase audit (task T028) | All API write handlers (POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE under `ui/src/app/api/`) that read `access_level` treat `admin_audit` and `shared_readonly` identically as "no write." No handler grants writes based on `access_level === 'admin_audit'` alone. |
| **Audit-log behaviour (defense in depth)** | Codebase audit (task T028) | Audit-log writers do not key exclusively on `access_level === 'admin_audit'`; reclassifying admin-on-autonomous as `shared_readonly` does not silently disable audit logging for views that policy requires to be logged. |
