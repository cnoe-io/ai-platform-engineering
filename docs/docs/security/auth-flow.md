# Authentication Flow

The CAIPE UI uses NextAuth for browser sessions and forwards validated server
credentials from the BFF to backend services such as Dynamic Agents, RAG, and
AgentGateway.

## Components

- **Browser**: renders the React UI and calls Next.js API routes.
- **Next.js BFF**: owns session validation, RBAC checks, service-account flows,
  and backend proxying.
- **OIDC provider**: Keycloak, Okta, Azure AD, or another OpenID Connect IdP.
- **Dynamic Agents**: validates bearer tokens for direct service calls and
  receives BFF-forwarded chat requests.
- **OpenFGA / AgentGateway**: enforces tool and MCP-server access on the data
  path when RBAC runtime is enabled.

## Login

```mermaid

    actor User
    participant Browser
    participant BFF as Next.js BFF
    participant IdP as OIDC Provider

    User->>Browser: Sign in
    Browser->>BFF: POST /api/auth/signin
    BFF->>IdP: Redirect to /authorize
    IdP-->>BFF: Authorization code
    BFF->>IdP: Exchange code for tokens
    IdP-->>BFF: access_token, id_token, refresh_token
    BFF-->>Browser: Encrypted session cookie
```

## Chat Request

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    actor User
    participant Browser
    participant BFF as Next.js BFF
    participant DA as Dynamic Agents

    User->>Browser: Send message
    Browser->>BFF: POST /api/v1/chat/stream/start
    BFF->>BFF: Validate session and conversation access
    BFF->>DA: Forward request with bearer token/context
    DA-->>BFF: Stream AG-UI/SSE events
    BFF-->>Browser: Stream response
```

The browser does not need direct network access to Dynamic Agents. Set
`DYNAMIC_AGENTS_URL` on the UI server so the BFF can reach the runtime.

## Token Refresh

NextAuth refreshes access tokens before expiry when the provider issues refresh
tokens. If refresh fails, the session receives an error flag and the UI prompts
the user to sign in again.

## Required Environment

```bash
SSO_ENABLED=true
OIDC_ISSUER=https://idp.example.com/realms/caipe
OIDC_CLIENT_ID=caipe-ui
OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET=<secret>
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=<random-secret>
NEXTAUTH_URL=https://caipe.example.com
DYNAMIC_AGENTS_URL=http://dynamic-agents:8001
```

For local Docker Compose with bundled Keycloak, `.env.example` provides working
development defaults.
