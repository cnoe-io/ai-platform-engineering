# Security & Auth Flows

CAIPE security is enforced in layers: the BFF owns the browser session, Dynamic
Agents validates bearer tokens, AgentGateway is the single MCP Policy
Enforcement Point, and OpenFGA handles all relationship-based authorization
decisions.

## Overview

    participant U as User
    participant UI as CAIPE UI/BFF
    participant IDP as Keycloak / OIDC

    participant AG as AgentGateway
    participant FGA as OpenFGA
    participant MCP as MCP Server

    U->>UI: Sign in and send message
    UI->>IDP: Validate session / obtain tokens
    UI->>DA: Start or resume chat stream
    DA->>AG: Call MCP tool
    AG->>AG: Verify JWT via JWKS (jwtAuth)
    AG->>FGA: Authorize caller and tool scope (extAuthz)
    FGA-->>AG: Allow or deny
    AG->>MCP: Forward allowed tool call
    MCP-->>AG: Tool result
    AG-->>DA: Tool result
    DA-->>UI: Stream response

## Controls

| Control | Purpose |
|---|---|
| NextAuth / OIDC | Browser session authentication |
| Keycloak | Identity provider, service accounts, token exchange |
| OpenFGA | Relationship and scope authorization (ReBAC) |
| AgentGateway | MCP route enforcement — jwtAuth + extAuthz |
| Agent Context HMAC | Per-agent tool policy via signed request headers |
| Audit service | Central audit log ingestion and querying |
