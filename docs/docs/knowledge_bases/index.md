# Knowledge Base Agents

## Knowledge Base Agents Overview

Knowledge Base Agents are designed to harness the power of structured and unstructured data to provide intelligent insights and solutions. These agents specialize in utilizing knowledge bases to enhance decision-making and problem-solving capabilities.

### Types of Knowledge Base Agents

1. **[RAG Agents](rag.md)**
  RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) Agents are tailored for working with platform runbooks and other forms of unstructured data. They excel at retrieving relevant information and generating contextually accurate responses, making them ideal for scenarios where quick access to critical knowledge is required.

2. **[Graph RAG-based Agents](graph_rag.md)**
  Graph RAG-based Agents focus on correlating and navigating knowledge graphs. By leveraging the interconnected nature of graph data, these agents provide deeper insights and uncover relationships between entities, enabling more comprehensive understanding and analysis.
