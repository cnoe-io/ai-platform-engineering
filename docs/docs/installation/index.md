# Installation

To get started with the installation process, you can choose from the following deployment options based on your environment and requirements:

- [Docker Compose](./docker-compose.md): Ideal for local development and testing.
- [Kind](./kind.md): A lightweight Kubernetes solution for local clusters.
- [EKS](./eks.md): For deploying on Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) in production environments.
