# Intro

Welcome to the AI Platform Engineering!

## What is AI Platform Engineering

As [Platform Engineering](https://platformengineering.org/blog/what-is-platform-engineering), [SRE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Site_reliability_engineering) and [DevOps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps) environments grow in complexity, traditional approaches can introduce delays and increase operational overhead for teams. Developers may experience frustration when workflows become inefficient or manual processes accumulate.

Using *Multi-Agentic Systems* Platform Engineering teams can address these challenges in platform engineering. This approach enables teams to:

<!-- - Automate repetitive and routine tasks
- Streamline development workflows
- Reduce manual intervention in day-to-day operations
- Focus engineering efforts on higher-value work -->

By incorporating Agentic AI, platform engineering shifts from manual, task-driven processes to more adaptive and efficient operations, allowing teams to better support development and business goals.

## Goals of the project

- Enable Platform Engineering teams with a curated, validated set of persona-specific multi-agent systems (MAS) tailored to their unique enterprise requirements.

- Foster an ecosystem of AI Platform Engineering practitioners to collaboratively develop high-quality, reusable prompt engineering libraries and commonly used platform tools.

## Who we are

We are Platform Engineers, SREs, and Developers from a variety of companies in the [CNCF](https://www.cncf.io/) and [CNOE.io](https://cnoe.io/) ecosystems, passionate about open source and advancing the use of agentic AI in Platform Engineering.
