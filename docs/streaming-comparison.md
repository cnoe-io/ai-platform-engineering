## Architecture Differences

| Aspect | v0.2.41 (Golden) | v0.3.0 |
|--------|-------------------|--------|
| Response mode | **Marker mode** (`[FINAL ANSWER]`) | **ResponseFormat tool** (`ToolStrategy(PlatformEngineerResponse)`) |
| Graph structure | Single LLM call, writes `[FINAL ANSWER]` then answer | Two-phase: supervisor LLM + `generate_structured_response` node (separate LLM call) |
| Streaming mechanism | Token-by-token from LLM after marker detected | Incremental JSON parsing of `PlatformEngineerResponse.content` field via `tool_call_chunks` |
| RAG enabled | No | Yes (adds 10-60s for search + fetch) |
| System prompt | Includes `[FINAL ANSWER]` section | Includes narration instructions (but LLM writes nothing before ResponseFormat) |

---

## Event Flow: Simple Query (`"what can you do?"`)

### v0.2.41 (Golden) - Total: 12.5s

| Time | A2A Event | Content | Slack Bot Sees |
|-----:|-----------|---------|----------------|
| 0.0s | HTTP POST `message/stream` | | Connection opened |
| 2.0s | `artifact` (streaming_result) | `"I'm an"` (6 chars) | **EventType.STREAMING_RESULT** - first content arrives. Opens stream (`startStream`). StreamBuffer begins accumulating. |
| 2.0-2.6s | `artifact` chunks | Word-by-word tokens | StreamBuffer accumulates; flushes on `\n\n` boundaries or 1s interval |
| 2.6-12.3s | `artifact` chunks (continuing) | ~216 chunks, gradual streaming | **User sees text building up word-by-word** in Slack |
| 12.5s | `artifact` (final_result) | Full text (2098 chars) | **EventType.FINAL_RESULT** -- skipped (already streamed via STREAMING_RESULT). `stopStream` called. |
| 12.5s | `task_completed` | | Done |

**Slack UX**: Text appears at **2.0s**, builds up smoothly over **10.5s**. No dead gaps. No tool indicators.

### v0.3.0 - Total: 18.2s

| Time | A2A Event | Content | Slack Bot Sees |
|-----:|-----------|---------|----------------|
| 0.0s | HTTP POST `message/stream` | | Connection opened |
| 0.0-17.8s | *(silence)* | | **17.8s dead gap** -- `generate_structured_response` LLM builds JSON preamble (`{"is_task_complete": true, ...}`). No events emitted. Slack shows typing indicator. |
| 17.8s | `artifact` (notification) | `"Composing answer..."` (23 chars) | **EventType.TOOL_NOTIFICATION_START** for `composing_answer` |
| 17.8s | `artifact` (streaming_result) | `"\n# "` (3 chars) | **EventType.STREAMING_RESULT** with `is_final_answer=True`. Opens stream. StreamBuffer starts. |
| 17.8-18.2s | `artifact` chunks (burst) | ~290 chunks in 0.4s burst | StreamBuffer accumulates; most arrives in single flush |
| 18.2s | `artifact` (final_result) | Full text (2571 chars) | **EventType.FINAL_RESULT** -- skipped (already streamed). `stopStream` called. |
| 18.2s | `task_completed` | | Done |

**Slack UX**: **17.8s of nothing** (typing indicator only), then entire answer appears in a ~0.4s burst. No gradual build-up.

---

## Event Flow: RAG Query (`"what is caipe?"`)

### v0.2.41 - Not available (RAG disabled)

0.2.41 does not have RAG enabled, so tool-triggering queries fall through to direct LLM response (no search/fetch). The LLM answers from its training data with marker-mode streaming.

### v0.3.0 - Total: 114.9s

| Time | A2A Event | Content | Slack Bot Sees |
|-----:|-----------|---------|----------------|
| 0.0s | HTTP POST | | Connection opened |
| 17.9s | `artifact` (streaming_result) | `"Workflow: Calling [RAG]..."` | **EventType.STREAMING_RESULT** -- pre-stream text, shown as typing status |
| 17.9s | `artifact` (tool start) | `"Supervisor: Calling List_Datasources..."` | Tool start notification |
| 17.9s | `artifact` (tool end) | `"Supervisor: List_Datasources completed"` | Tool end |
| 19.1s | `artifact` (workflow) | `"Calling Search..."` x2 | RAG search started (parallel) |
| 19.1s | `artifact` (streaming_result) | `"Now let me run both"` | Narrative text -- shown as typing status (stream not open yet) |
| 24.8-27.6s | `artifact` (streaming_result) | `"searches returned strong results..."` | More narrative; still typing status |
| 27.6s | `artifact` (workflow) | `"Search completed"` x2 | Search done |
| 63.3s | `artifact` (workflow) | `"Fetch_Document..."` x2 | RAG document fetch (parallel) |
| 65.0s | `artifact` (workflow) | `"Fetch completed"` x2 | Fetch done |
| 65.0-104.9s | `artifact` (streaming_result) | `"Synthesize findings..."` + text | Synthesis narrative; typing status |
| 104.9s | `artifact` (summary) | Research process summary (686 chars) | Narrative text |
| 114.6s | `artifact` (notification) | `"Composing answer..."` | `composing_answer` typing status |
| 114.6s | `artifact` (streaming_result) | `"# What is CAIPE?"` | **Stream opens** -- `is_final_answer=True`. First real content. |
| 114.6-114.9s | `artifact` chunks (burst) | ~300 chunks in 0.3s | StreamBuffer flushes; answer appears as burst |
| 114.9s | `artifact` (final_result) | Full text (2870 chars) | Skipped (already streamed) |
| 114.9s | `task_completed` | | Done |

**Slack UX**: Typing indicator for **114.6s** with periodic status updates, then answer appears in a **0.3s burst**.

## Side-by-Side: What the User Sees in Slack

| Phase | v0.2.41 (Golden) | v0.3.0 |
|-------|-------------------|--------|
| **0-2s** | Typing indicator ("is thinking...") | Typing indicator ("is thinking...") |
| **2-5s** | Text streaming word-by-word | Still typing indicator (no events yet) |
| **5-12s** | Text continues building up gradually | Still typing indicator |
| **12s** | Complete (full answer visible) | Still typing indicator |
| **12-18s** | *(done)* | Still typing indicator -> "is composing the answer..." |
| **18s** | *(done)* | **Entire answer appears at once** (burst) |

### Key UX Differences

| Metric | v0.2.41 (Golden) | v0.3.0 | Delta |
|--------|-------------------|--------|-------|
| Time to first visible content | **2.0s** | **17.8s** | +15.8s worse |
| Streaming duration (visible build-up) | **10.5s** | **0.4s** | -10.1s (no gradual feel) |
| Total time (simple query) | **12.5s** | **18.2s** | +5.7s worse |
| User perception | "Fast, responsive, building answer" | "Long wait, then dump" |

## Token Streaming Detail

### v0.2.41: Real Token-by-Token

```
t=2.0s  "I'm an"           -> StreamBuffer
t=2.0s  " **"              -> StreamBuffer
t=2.0s  "AI Platform Eng..." -> StreamBuffer
t=2.6s  " auto"            -> flush to Slack (1s interval)
t=2.6s  "mate, and coord..." -> StreamBuffer
t=3.0s  " Capabilities"    -> flush to Slack (\n\n boundary)
...continues for 10.5s...
```

Each token arrives ~400-500ms apart. StreamBuffer flushes on paragraph breaks (`\n\n`) or 1s time intervals, creating smooth visual progression.

### v0.3.0: Burst After JSON Parsing

```
t=0-17.8s   (silence -- LLM building JSON: {"is_task_complete": true, "content": "...)
t=17.8s     "Composing answer..." -> typing status
t=17.8s     "\n# "               -> StreamBuffer (is_final_answer)
t=17.8s     "Hi! Here'"          -> StreamBuffer
t=17.8s     "s what I "          -> StreamBuffer
...290 chunks in 0.4s...
t=18.2s     (done)               -> single flush
```

The incremental JSON parser extracts content tokens from the ResponseFormat tool_call_chunks, but they arrive in bursts because:
1. The `generate_structured_response` LLM must first write the JSON preamble before reaching the `content` key
2. Once content starts flowing, network buffering groups many tokens together
3. The effective streaming window is only ~0.4s

---

## Tool Notification Flow

### v0.2.41

Tools are called inline by the supervisor LLM. No dedicated tool notifications exist -- the LLM simply writes narrative text between tool calls:

```
[LLM writes]: "Let me search the knowledge base..."
[tool executes]: search()
[LLM writes]: "Found 3 results. Let me analyze..."
[LLM writes]: "[FINAL ANSWER]\n# Answer here..."
              ^ marker gate opens, streaming begins
```

Everything before `[FINAL ANSWER]` is suppressed. Only post-marker content reaches the client.

### v0.3.0

The supervisor emits tool notifications as structured events:

```
artifact: "Workflow: Calling [RAG] Search..."     -> TOOL_NOTIFICATION_START
artifact: "Supervisor: Calling Agent Search..."    -> TOOL_NOTIFICATION_START
artifact: "Supervisor: Agent task Search completed"-> TOOL_NOTIFICATION_END
artifact: "Composing answer..."                    -> TOOL_NOTIFICATION_START (composing_answer)
artifact: (streaming_result chunks)                -> STREAMING_RESULT (is_final_answer)
artifact: (final_result)                           -> FINAL_RESULT
```

Slack maps these to typing statuses:
- Tool starts -> `_set_typing_status("is working...")`
- `composing_answer` -> `_set_typing_status("is composing the answer...")`
- First `is_final_answer` chunk -> opens stream, begins `appendStream`

---

## Final Response Delivery

| Aspect | v0.2.41 | v0.3.0 |
|--------|---------|--------|
| Source of final text | LLM output after `[FINAL ANSWER]` marker | `PlatformEngineerResponse.content` field from ResponseFormat tool |
| Delivery mechanism | Token-by-token via marker gate | Incremental JSON parser extracting from `tool_call_chunks` |
| A2A artifact type | `streaming_result` (each token) -> `final_result` (full text) | `streaming_result` (`is_final_answer=True`, each parsed token) -> `final_result` (full text) |
| Duplication guard | `streaming_final_answer` flag in Slack bot | Same flag + `streaming_artifact_id` guard in agent_executor |
| Format | Raw markdown | Structured JSON with `is_task_complete`, `require_user_input`, `content` fields |
| Extra metadata | None | `was_task_successful`, `input_fields` (for HITL forms) |

---

## Slack Bot Event Processing Pipeline

```
A2A SSE Event
  |
  +-- EventType.STREAMING_RESULT
  |    +-- has is_final_answer? -> latch streaming_final_answer = True
  |    +-- has is_narration? -> typing status (configurable via SLACK_NARRATION_AS_TYPING)
  |    +-- pre-stream (no stream_ts)?
  |    |    +-- plan step in progress? -> accumulate in step_thinking
  |    |    +-- no plan? -> show as typing status
  |    +-- stream open (stream_ts set)?
  |         +-- StreamBuffer.append(text)
  |              +-- \n\n found? -> flush to paragraph boundary
  |              +-- 1s elapsed + >=40 chars? -> flush to last \n
  |              +-- else -> keep buffering
  |
  +-- EventType.FINAL_RESULT
  |    +-- streaming_final_answer = True? -> SKIP (already streamed)
  |    +-- not streamed? -> StreamBuffer.append + flush
  |
  +-- EventType.TOOL_NOTIFICATION_START
  |    +-- composing_answer? -> typing status "is composing the answer..."
  |    +-- other tool? -> open stream if needed, no text pushed
  |
  +-- EventType.TOOL_NOTIFICATION_END
  |    +-- update typing status, clear tool indicator
  |
  +-- EventType.EXECUTION_PLAN
       +-- update plan step cards, track step completion
```

## Root Cause: Why 0.3.0 Feels Worse

1. **`generate_structured_response` is a separate LLM call** that builds a full JSON response. The JSON schema requires `is_task_complete` and `require_user_input` before `content`, so the LLM writes ~100 tokens of JSON preamble before the first content character appears.

2. **No narration in structured mode.** The supervisor LLM (first call) goes directly to the ResponseFormat tool without writing any visible text. In marker mode (0.2.41), the same LLM writes thinking text + `[FINAL ANSWER]` + answer -- all streamed.

3. **Network buffering collapses streaming.** Even with the incremental JSON parser extracting word-boundary-aligned deltas, the tokens arrive in bursts (grouped by HTTP chunk boundaries), not one-by-one like direct LLM streaming.

4. **RAG adds 60-100s of tool time** before the final answer. During this time, only typing status indicators are visible -- no text streams.

## Recommendations

To restore v0.2.41's streaming UX in v0.3.0:

| Option | Approach | Tradeoff |
|--------|----------|----------|
| **A. Switch to marker mode** | Set `USE_STRUCTURED_RESPONSE=false` | Loses `PlatformEngineerResponse` metadata (input_fields, is_task_complete). Web UI needs adaptation. |
| **B. Hybrid mode** | Build graph in marker mode; construct structured response in `agent_executor.py` post-stream | Best of both: real streaming + structured A2A artifacts. |
| **C. Narration bridge** | Emit LLM narrative text as streaming_result during tool execution | Addresses the gap but not the burst-vs-gradual issue. Already partially done via `composing_answer`. |
| **D. Pre-content streaming** | Parse JSON preamble tokens and emit synthetic "Preparing response..." events | Cosmetic fix; doesn't change the fundamental burst delivery. |

**Recommendation**: Option A was implemented in PR #1210 (`USE_STRUCTURED_RESPONSE=false`) as the immediate fix. Option B remains the long-term goal.

### 0.3.0 -- 18 artifacts

**Artifact 0**: `tool_notification_start` -- Tool call started: [RAG] Search knowledge base
- Parts: 1, Text: `Workflow: Calling [RAG] Search knowledge base for CAIPE setup options...`

**Artifact 1**: `execution_plan_status_update` -- Step "Search knowledge base" in_progress

**Artifacts 2-5**: Tool start/end for `search` and `list_datasources_and_entity_types`

**Artifacts 6-13**: Tool start/end for `fetch_document` (x3) and `search` (x1)

**Artifact 14**: `tool_notification_end` -- RAG workflow completed

**Artifact 15**: `execution_plan_status_update` -- Step completed

**Artifact 16**: `streaming_result` -- 288 token chunks, `is_final_answer: true`, 3225 chars total
```
  [  0] "\n\n##"
  [  1] " "
  [  2] "🚀 CA"
  [  3] "IPE Setup"
  [  4] " Options"
  [  5] "\n\nCAIPE offers"
  [  6] " **"
  [  7] "5"
  [  8] " deployment paths"
  [  9] "** depending"
  ... (278 more chunks)
```

**Artifact 17**: `final_result` -- 3223 chars, full answer text

### 0.2.41 -- 4 artifacts

**Artifact 0**: `tool_notification_start` -- Tool call started: `task`

**Artifact 1**: `streaming_result` -- 268 token chunks, 11583 chars total
- Note: 0.2.41 leaks LLM narration ("Excellent! I now have comprehensive information...") at the start
- First chunk contains the full preamble (1929 chars) -- this is pre-marker buffer that flushed
```
  [  0] "Excellent! I now have comprehensive information..."  (1929 chars -- narration leak)
  [  1] "#"
  [  2] " 🤖 CAIPE"
  [  3] " Setup Options"
  ... (264 more chunks)
```

**Artifact 2**: `tool_notification_end` -- Task completed

**Artifact 3**: `partial_result` -- 11583 chars (0.2.41 uses `partial_result`, not `final_result`)

### Comparison Summary

| Metric | 0.3.0 | 0.2.41 |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Total artifacts | 18 | 4 |
| Tool notifications (start/end) | 7/7 | 1/1 |
| streaming_result count | 1 | 1 |
| Total streaming parts | 288 | 268 |
| Total streaming text | 3225 chars | 11583 chars |
| has is_final_answer | True | False |
| has is_narration | False | False |
| has execution_plan | True | False |
| Final artifact name | final_result | partial_result |

### Key Deltas

1. **0.3.0 has `is_final_answer: true`** on streaming_result -- enables Slack bot to know when to open the stream
2. **0.3.0 breaks down RAG tools** -- search, list_datasources, fetch_document as separate notifications vs 0.2.41's single `task`
3. **0.3.0 has `execution_plan_status_update`** -- UI can show step progress
4. **0.2.41 leaks LLM narration** -- "Excellent! I now have comprehensive information..." appears in streaming_result (pre-marker buffer flush)
5. **0.2.41 uses `partial_result`** -- 0.3.0 uses `final_result` as completion artifact
6. **0.3.0 answer is more concise** -- 3225 chars vs 11583 chars (RAG grounding produces tighter answers)
