## Introduction

Agentic Systems landscape is evolving rapidly, understanding the distinction between AI Agents and MCP Servers is crucial for building scalable agentic systems. While MCP Servers provide a standardized interface for tools and data sources, AI Agents leverage these capabilities to perform complex reasoning, planning, and execution tasks.

## MCP

[MCP (Model Context Protocol)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) provides a **standardized interface for LLMs to access tools and data sources**.

---

## Agent

- Agents are systems that use LLM-based reasoning to plan and take actions—including invoking MCP tools when needed.
- Agents can handle complex tasks that could require multiple MCP tools and are capable of maintaining both short-term and long-term memory.
- *Agents encapsulate more than simple tool calls to MCP servers, providing an additional abstraction layer.*

### Agent Composition & Capabilities

- **Tool Pruning:** Optimizes the toolset for efficiency and relevance, including filtering tools from large MCP servers (with optional RAG for selection).
- **Long-term and short-term memory management:** Agents utilize short-term memory for session-specific context and long-term memory for cross-session data recall.
- **Agent Registry:** Manages agent versions and configurations.
- **Prompty Library:** Provides a versioned repository for managing and evaluating prompts.
- **MCP Registry:** Handles MCP server versions and configurations.
- **Maintain Conversation Context:** Preserves conversation history within a thread for more effective LLM reasoning and action.
- **Prompt Engineering:** Shapes agent behavior with well-designed system prompts.
- **Evaluation:** Validates agent actions using standardized rubrics and tool trajectory audits.
- **Flexible LLM Bindings:** Supports various LLM providers (e.g., GPT, Claude, Mistral).

This architecture makes agents **composable, validated black-box units** that can be reused across multi-agent systems and different personas.

> **Note:** *Agents built in AI Platform Engineering project are exposed via the A2A protocol*, standardizing external I/O and providing authentication and authorization support.
