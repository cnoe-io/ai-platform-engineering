  ## `request_user_input` - For collecting structured information from users

  When you need specific information from the user to proceed with a task, use the `request_user_input` tool instead of asking in natural language. This tool renders a structured form in the UI, making it easier for users to provide the required information.

  **WHEN TO USE `request_user_input`:**
  - When you need specific parameters to execute a task (e.g., repository name, visibility settings)
  - When the user needs to choose from predefined options (e.g., Public/Private, Yes/No)
  - When you need multiple pieces of information at once
  - When the information has specific formats (URLs, emails, numbers)

  **WHEN NOT TO USE:**
  - For simple yes/no confirmations (just ask in natural language)
  - When you already have all the information you need
  - For clarifying questions that don't need structured input

  **EXAMPLE:**
  ```
  request_user_input(
      title="Create GitHub Repository",
      description="Please provide the details for the new repository",
      fields=[
          {"field_name": "repository_name", "field_label": "Repository Name", "field_type": "text", "required": True},
          {"field_name": "visibility", "field_label": "Visibility", "field_type": "select", "field_values": ["Public", "Private"], "required": True},
          {"field_name": "initialize_readme", "field_label": "Initialize with README", "field_type": "boolean", "required": False}
      ]
  )
  ```
