  Generate a combined release blog post for ai-platform-engineering.
  Produces a single docs/releases/YYYY-MM-DD-release-X-Y-Z.md file containing
  release notes and the upgrade guide (migration guide) inline.
  Use when cutting a release, when a user asks "what changed in 0.4.x", or when
  upgrading their values.yaml to a new chart version.

# Release Blog Post Generator

Produce one combined blog post for an `ai-platform-engineering` release:

**`docs/releases/YYYY-MM-DD-release-X-Y-Z.md`** — release notes narrative
(highlights, what's new, bug fixes, breaking changes) followed by the full
upgrade guide (Helm values diff, step-by-step runbook, personal impact
analysis) as an embedded section.

The file is picked up by the Docusaurus `releases` blog plugin and published at
`/blog/releases/release-X.Y.Z`.

---

## Execution context

Runs in two modes:

- **Coding agent** (Claude Code, Cursor) with shell access — run `git` and `helm`
  commands directly and write the file to disk.
- **Chat-only** (CAIPE chat, Slack, web UI) — render output as a fenced markdown
  block the user can copy; note which commands to run manually.

Detect by whether a `Bash`/shell tool is available.

---

## Step 1 — Gather inputs

Ask the user for:

| Input | Example | Required |
|-------|---------|----------|
| **To version** | `0.4.9` | Yes |
| **From version** | `0.4.8` | Yes (defaults to previous tag) |
| **User's `values.yaml`** | paste or path | No — enables personal impact analysis |
| **Environment** | `dev` / `preview` / `prod` / `vm` | No — enables env-specific notes |

If from/to are not provided, detect from the repo:

```bash
git tag --sort=-version:refname | grep -E '^[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+$' | head -2
```

---

## Step 2 — Collect raw data

Run all of the following in parallel where possible.

### 2a — Git log between versions

```bash
git log <from>..<to> --oneline --no-merges
```

Fetch full PR bodies for non-chore commits:

```bash
# for each PR number in the log, e.g. (#1324):
gh pr view <number> --json title,body,labels
```

### 2b — Helm values diff

```bash
CHART=oci://ghcr.io/cnoe-io/charts/ai-platform-engineering
helm show values "$CHART" --version <from> > /tmp/values-from.yaml
helm show values "$CHART" --version <to>   > /tmp/values-to.yaml
diff -u /tmp/values-from.yaml /tmp/values-to.yaml
```

### 2c — Chart metadata

```bash
helm show chart "$CHART" --version <to>
```

### 2d — CHANGELOG.md

```bash
sed -n '/^## <to>/,/^## <from>/p' CHANGELOG.md
```

---

## Step 3 — Classify changes

### Classify git commits

| Type | Criteria |
|------|----------|
| **Feature** | `feat(*)` commits |
| **Fix** | `fix(*)` commits |
| **Security** | commits touching Dockerfile, securityContext, PSS/PSA |
| **Breaking** | commit body contains "BREAKING CHANGE" or PR label `breaking-change` |
| **Chore / Internal** | `chore`, `refactor`, `ci`, `test` — omit from user-facing notes |

### Classify Helm values diff lines

| Category | Criteria |
|----------|----------|
| **Breaking** | Key renamed, removed, or type changed |
| **New required** | New key with no default |
| **New optional** | New key with working default |
| **Deprecated** | Key still works but will be removed |
| **Default changed** | Same key, different default value |

---

## Step 4 — Write `docs/releases/YYYY-MM-DD-release-X-Y-Z.md`

Use the date the tag was pushed (or today's date if cutting now).

```markdown
---
slug: release-<to>
title: "Release <to> — <2-5 word subtitle capturing the biggest change>"
date: <YYYY-MM-DD>
authors: [sriaradhyula]
tags: [release]
---

## Highlights

<2-4 sentence narrative of the most significant changes in plain English.
Focus on operator/user impact, not internal implementation details.>

<!-- truncate -->

## What's New

### <Feature area 1>
- **<Title>** — <one-line description linking to PR #NNNN>

### <Feature area 2>
- ...

## Bug Fixes

- **<scope>**: <description> ([#NNNN](https://github.com/cnoe-io/ai-platform-engineering/pull/NNNN))

## Security

<Any security-context, PSS, or CVE-related changes. Omit section if none.>

## Breaking Changes

<If none:>
No breaking changes. Drop-in upgrade from <from>.

## Known Issues

<If none:>
None known at this time.

---

## Upgrade Guide: <from> → <to>

### Overview

<One paragraph: overall theme, e.g. "Drop-in upgrade — no values.yaml edits required.">

### Helm Values Changes

<If no diff:>
No Helm values changes between <from> and <to>. Drop-in upgrade.

<If diff exists, use these subsections:>

#### Breaking Changes

**Affected key**: `global.foo.bar`

**Before (<from>)**:
```yaml
global:
  foo:
    bar: "old-value"
```

**After (<to>)**:
```yaml
global:
  foo:
    bar: "new-value"
```

**Action**: Update your `values.yaml`. If left unchanged, <consequence>.

#### New Optional Fields

| Env Var / Key | Default | Description |
|---------------|---------|-------------|
| `TOOL_CALL_LIMIT` | `0` (disabled) | Max tool invocations per run |

#### Deprecated / Removed Keys

| Key | Removed in | Replacement |
|-----|-----------|-------------|
| `tags.old-key` | <to> | `global.newKey` |

### Upgrade Runbook

#### 1. Update chart version

```bash
helm upgrade ai-platform-engineering \
  oci://ghcr.io/cnoe-io/charts/ai-platform-engineering \
  --version <to> \
  -f your-values.yaml
```

#### 2. Apply values.yaml changes

<Paste exact diffs for each breaking change.>

#### 3. Verify

```bash
kubectl get pods -n <namespace>
```

### Personal Impact Analysis

<If user provided values.yaml: cross-reference against breaking-changes list.>
<If not: prompt them to provide it for a personalised checklist.>

### Full Values Diff

<details>
<summary>Raw diff (<from> → <to>)</summary>

```diff
<paste diff output>
```

</details>
```

## Step 5 — Write file to disk (coding agent)

```bash
mkdir -p docs/releases

cat > docs/releases/<YYYY-MM-DD>-release-<X-Y-Z>.md << 'EOF'
<generated content>
EOF
```

---

## Step 6 — Snapshot and prune Docusaurus versions (coding agent)

After writing the blog post, snapshot the current `docs/` tree as the new version
and prune old snapshots to stay within the retention policy.

**Retention policy**:
- Latest **5** releases from the current minor series (e.g. `0.4.7`–`0.4.11`)
- Highest release from **each previous minor series** (e.g. `0.3.11`, `0.2.x`)

Run from repo root:

```bash
NEW_VERSION=<to> node docs/scripts/snapshot-and-prune-versions.js
```

This script:
1. Runs `docusaurus docs:version <to>` — snapshots `docs/` into `versioned_docs/version-<to>/`
2. Prunes `versioned_docs/`, `versioned_sidebars/`, and `versions.json` to the retention policy
3. Updates `docs/versions-config.json` — sets `lastVersion`, marks `<to>` as `(Latest)`, removes pruned entries

Commit all release artifacts together:

```bash
git add docs/releases/<YYYY-MM-DD>-release-<X-Y-Z>.md
git add docs/versioned_docs/ docs/versioned_sidebars/
git add docs/versions.json docs/versions-config.json
git commit -s -m "docs: release <to> — blog post, docs snapshot, version prune"
```

## Guidelines

- `<!-- truncate -->` goes immediately after the Highlights section so the blog
  list shows just the intro paragraph
- Show concrete before/after YAML for every breaking change — never prose-only
- For breaking changes, state the *consequence* of not updating
- Keep the upgrade runbook linear — steps should be self-contained
- If `helm show values` is unavailable, ask the user to paste output — never guess
- Highlight environment-specific notes (VM kind clusters use `standard` storageClass; EKS uses `gp2`/`gp3`)
- For `ExternalSecret` additions, list the exact Vault path and key the chart now expects
- Omit `chore`, `ci`, `test`, and `refactor` commits from user-facing notes
- If there are zero helm value changes, say so explicitly and reassure it is a drop-in upgrade
- Do NOT create separate migration guide files — the upgrade guide lives inside the release post
