/**
 * Apply an identity-group-sync plan to Mongo + OpenFGA with strong
 * consistency guarantees against partial failure.
 *
 * The plan is applied in two transactional phases:
 *
 *  Phase 1 — Team materialization. For each team in `teams_to_create`,
 *  Mongo `insertOne` runs first (because team OpenFGA tuples reference
 *  the freshly-minted ObjectId). If the insert succeeds, the team is
 *  considered "owned by this transaction" and is rolled back (deleted)
 *  if any subsequent step in this same `applyIdentityGroupSyncPlan` call
 *  fails. Teams that already existed by slug are NOT rolled back — they
 *  weren't ours to begin with.
 *
 *  Phase 2 — Membership-source + tuple reconciliation. The membership
 *  source upserts in Mongo happen first (they're cheap to roll back via
 *  `markTeamMembershipSourceRemoved`), then the OpenFGA tuple writes
 *  (and deletes) happen via `writeOpenFgaTuples`, which internally
 *  chunks to OpenFGA's 100-tuples-per-call limit and self-compensates
 *  any chunks that succeeded before a later chunk failed. If the
 *  OpenFGA call still throws after self-compensation, this function
 *  rolls back its own Mongo changes from both phases:
 *    - Phase 2 rollback: mark each newly-upserted membership source as
 *      `removed` (idempotent — re-running reconciliation will re-add).
 *    - Phase 1 rollback: delete the teams we created in this call (the
 *      OpenFGA team tuples are already self-compensated by the
 *      writeOpenFgaTuples helper).
 *
 *  The `membership_sources_to_remove` and `tuple_deletes` paths are
 *  applied in the same Phase 2 transaction. If they fail, the same
 *  rollback discipline applies.
 *
 *  This is a best-effort rollback — if the rollback itself fails (e.g.
 *  Mongo is unreachable mid-rollback), we log loudly and surface the
 *  ORIGINAL error so the caller can react. Callers MUST be prepared for
 *  the rare "rollback failed, system in inconsistent state" case (the
 *  identity-group-sync UI surfaces this via run history; the auth-config
 *  login path catches and warn-logs).
