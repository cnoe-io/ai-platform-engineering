// Archiving a team must also revoke every resource grant that flows through
// the team's `#member` / `#admin` userset — otherwise `team:<slug>#member
// can_use agent:X` still resolves true for anyone still on the roster, so an
// "archived" team would keep granting access. `team.status` is NOT consulted
// anywhere in the OpenFGA authorization path (OpenFGA is the source of truth),
// so archival is only real if the tuples go with it.
//
// What we strip: tuples where the archived team's userset is the SUBJECT —
//   team:<slug>#member  <relation>  <resource:id>
//   team:<slug>#admin   manager     <resource:id>
// across every shareable resource type (agent, skill, task, tool,
// knowledge_base, mcp_server, secret_ref, slack_channel, webex_space,
// conversation, service_account, ...).
//
// What we KEEP: the membership roster itself — `user:<sub> member team:<slug>`
// (the team is the OBJECT there, never the subject). Keeping the roster means
// un-archiving a team can restore its grants by replaying resource
// reconciliation, and the admin UI still shows who was on the team.
//
// Deletes go through `deleteExactOpenFgaTuples` with keys read straight from
// the store. Userset tuples (`team:<slug>#member ...`) MUST be deleted this
// way: `writeOpenFgaTuples` runs a per-tuple `/check` that cannot resolve a
// userset as the `user`, so it would treat every such delete as "already gone"
// and silently drop it (see the note on `deleteExactOpenFgaTuples`).
