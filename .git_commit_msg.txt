fix(ui): persist conversation titles to MongoDB on auto-generation

Added updateConversationTitle method to chat store that saves titles
to MongoDB when they are auto-generated from the first user message.
This ensures conversation titles persist across page reloads.

Changes:
- Added updateConversationTitle method with optimistic updates
- Updated addMessage to save auto-generated titles to MongoDB
- Titles are now persisted immediately when generated

Fixes issue where conversation titles were lost on page reload.
