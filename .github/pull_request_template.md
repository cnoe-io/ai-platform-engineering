## Temporary Helm Charts (Optional)

For chart changes, you can test temporary versions before merging:
- **Base repo contributors:** Create a branch starting with `prebuild/` for automatic prebuilds
- **Fork contributors:** Ask a maintainer to add the `helm-prerelease` label
- Temporary charts are published to `ghcr.io/caipe-io/charts` with PR-specific versions
- Cleanup happens automatically when the PR closes or label is removed
