"""Slack chat-envelope augmentation.

Phase 1 of the channel-derived team binding migration (spec
2026-05-24-derive-team-from-channel, FR-016) adds the originating
channel/workspace/thread/surface context to the outbound chat envelope so
the RAG server can derive `team_id` from `channel_id` instead of relying
on a JWT team claim (which no longer exists).

The Dynamic Agents `ClientContext` model uses `extra="allow"`, so adding
these keys is a no-op for any downstream consumer that doesn't know about
them; consumers that DO care (RAG, future PDP) read them directly.
