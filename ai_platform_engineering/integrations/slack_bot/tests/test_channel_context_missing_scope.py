"""Regression tests for `get_channel_context` graceful handling of
`missing_scope` from Slack's `conversations.info` endpoint.

Why these tests exist:
    Operators kept seeing repeated "Could not fetch channel info" warnings
    in production when the Slack app manifest was missing `channels:read`
    (and friends). The bot still worked — channel topic/purpose context just
    came back empty — but the warning fired on *every* message, which
    drowned out real errors. The fix is a one-shot warning + result caching
    so we don't keep hammering Slack with calls that will always fail.
