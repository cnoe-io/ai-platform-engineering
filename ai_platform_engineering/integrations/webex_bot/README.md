# Webex Bot

For routing, identity linking, and deployment configuration, see the
[integration guide](../../../docs/docs/integrations/webex-bot.md).

## Reply limits

- `WEBEX_MESSAGE_MAX_EDITS`: 1–20 edits per message; defaults to 10. One edit is
  reserved for completion or errors. Use 20 only with a confirmed higher API limit.
- `CAIPE_UI_BASE_URL`: public browser URL for full-response links; falls back to
  `WEBEX_LINKING_BASE_URL`. Example: `https://chat.example.com`.
- `APP_NAME`: deployment name used in reply footers and link labels.

Streaming updates require 240 new characters and a one-second interval. Replies
fit within 7,439 UTF-8 bytes, including the footer. Oversized replies keep the
original text prefix, reserving at least 100 bytes for the link and expanding that
reservation to fit the actual URL. No model call is made for truncation.

New successful turns persist full user/assistant text through the existing
OBO-authenticated messages API. A truncated reply links to `/chat/<conversation-id>`
only after that write succeeds. Existing conversation permissions still apply;
Webex space membership does not grant browser access. Older metadata-only turns
are not backfilled. Missing/invalid public URLs or failed writes produce an
explicit link-unavailable notice.
