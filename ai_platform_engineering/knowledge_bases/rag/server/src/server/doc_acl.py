"""Hybrid ACL: per-document ACL tag filtering on top of datasource-level RBAC.

Design
------

The existing RAG RBAC stack (``server.rbac``) already gates queries at
the **datasource** (``datasource_id``) granularity via OpenFGA. That
works well for component-level access inside a knowledge base.

Hybrid ACL adds a second, **finer** filter applied at query time:
``metadata.acl_tags`` IN <user's tag set>.

Concretely, every document indexed into Milvus may carry a list of
``acl_tags`` (strings) on its ``metadata`` dict. Common pattern:

- ``["__public__"]`` — readable by every authenticated user.

Non-public tag vocabularies must be backed by explicit authorization logic
rather than static IdP or AD group claims.

Resolution at query time:

1. The caller's tag-set is computed from the literal ``__public__``.
2. The Milvus filter ``metadata.acl_tags in [<user tags>]`` is
   AND-merged into the existing filter expression.

Feature flag
------------

This module is **off by default** (``RBAC_DOC_ACL_TAGS_ENABLED=false``)
so deployments that haven't migrated their indexes don't suddenly
return empty results.

When OFF:
  - ``derive_user_acl_tags`` returns []
  - ``apply_doc_acl_filter`` is a no-op
  - the query path does not add document ACL filters.

When ON:
  - ``apply_doc_acl_filter`` injects the metadata.acl_tags filter on
    every authenticated query.
  - Documents with no acl_tags are **invisible**. Backfill existing
    collections before enabling the filter.

Why a flag rather than a hard cutover: Milvus does not support
"missing-key" filters cleanly (you'd have to scan), so we cannot
"fall through to allow" for un-tagged docs. The migration step is
mandatory before flipping the flag.

Extension points:
  - UI for assigning acl_tags to documents at ingest time.
  - Per-tenant tag dictionary / validation in the BFF.
  - Connector-side doc tagging during ingestion.

    No-op when the feature flag is off or when the caller is a

    Merge semantics:

      - If no existing ``metadata.acl_tags`` filter, set it to the
        user's tag set (Milvus will treat a list as ``IN``).
      - If a string was already passed in (caller-supplied
        constraint), keep it ONLY if it's also in the user's tag
        set; otherwise the result will be empty.
      - If a list was passed, intersect it with the user's tag set;
        if the intersection is empty, set the filter to a sentinel
        value (``["__noresults__"]``) so the vector search returns
        nothing rather than silently widening to the user's full set.

    The third rule prevents a subtle escalation where a malicious or
    buggy caller could pass an ACL tag they are not authorized to use.
