Production Readiness Checklist Template
¶
A list of the items that need to be fulfilled for an application to be ready for a deployment to Production. This checklist is the second phase of the
New Application Onboarding Checklist
. These items are not all necessary before going live. However, they should be called out as action items to be completed as quickly as possible if a deployment to production does not have all of them.
Following the Shared Responsibility model, there are some items that are solely the responsibility of the Platform team and some that are solely the responsibility of the application team. There are also some items require both teams to work together to complete.
This checklist, like the CSDL, is a living document. A re-review should occur when there is a change to the application that requires a modification to the Threat Model.
