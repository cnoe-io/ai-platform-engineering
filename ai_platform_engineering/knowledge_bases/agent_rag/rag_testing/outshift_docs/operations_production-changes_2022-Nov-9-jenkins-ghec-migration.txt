Background
¶
We have been experiencing several 504's on EngIT Jenkins when user clones a wwwin-github repo
Cisco IT Update:
Unfortunately, I haven't been able to take any immediate action from GitHub to fix this problem because it appears that the LDAP server is the source of these timeouts. The LDAP team has not yet responded, as far as I can tell. Since the RTP site experiences a higher proportion of errors, let me try to failover that site as a workaround, which might lower the number of occurrences you are experiencing. Will notify you when the site has failed over so that you can monitor the issue.
There is not immediate resolution from EngIT on this on-going issue
ETI SRE team mirrored sre-pipeline-library to
GHEC
