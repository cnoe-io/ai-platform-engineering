Users with appropriate permissions can log into GHEC and navigate to

.
To manage a specific team, click on the team as it appears in the list, then click on the "Members" tab near the top.
To remove a member, check the box that appears to the left of their name, then use the drop-down box that appears at the top of the list to remove them.
To add a member, click the green "Add a Member" button that appears to the top right of the list. Type their username into the box and then click the green "Invite" button. The user will then be added to the team.
