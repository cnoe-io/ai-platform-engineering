Opentelemetry
¶
Opentelemetry is an obervability framework.
We deploy a specific distribution of the otel collector called ADOT in each Kubernetes clusters (AWS EKS) in order to collect high level metrics, ingested by Amazon Managed Prometheus (as opposed to a local instance of Prometheus also to be deployed in a given cluster).
This provides visibility on how the platform is behaving as well as applications deployed in those clusters.
