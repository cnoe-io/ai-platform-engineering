Overview
¶
Diagram Reference
Observability tools enable developers to understand the internal state of their deployed applications from their external outputs.
For
logs
, Outshift Platform leverages
AppDynamic FSO Cisco Cloud Observability
For
local Kubernetes metrics
, dashboards and alerts Outshift Platform leverages
Kube Prometheus Stack
For
long-term SLI Metrics
, Kubernetes, and Push Gateway metrics, Outshift Platform uses Amazon Managed Prometheus(
https://aws.amazon.com/prometheus/)(AMP
) as a long-term metrics source and aggregation point.
Metrics
¶
Kube Prometheus Stack (KPS)
¶
Kube Prometheus Stack
, a collection of Kubernetes manifests,
Grafana
dashboards, and
Prometheus rules
combined with documentation and scripts to provide easy-to-operate end-to-end Kubernetes cluster monitoring with
Prometheus
using the
Prometheus Operator
.
The
Platform Demo
repo provides an example of a real application that packages all the required Kubernetes manifests in its
helm-chart
templates.
Amazon Managed Prometheus (AMP)
¶
Amazon Managed Prometheus
is used as the primary set of platform and application metrics.
Dashboards and Alerts
¶
Central Grafana Dashboard
¶
Outshift Platform uses AWS Managed Grafana to host
https://observability.outshift.io
central observability grafana
Central Platform and Application Dashboards are at
https://observability.outshift.io
Application metrics exported in Prometheus format to a metrics endpoint are automatically scraped and made available for visualization by Grafana. See
Metrics
for more details.
Persistence and Backups
¶
Central Observability automatically persists any changes
TBD (future): SRE will perform daily backups of dashboards, alerts, notifications, and contact points to an S3 bucket.
Cluster-Specific Grafana Endpoint
¶
Kubernetes clusters have Kube Prometheus Stack installed, and Grafana can be accessed through the cluster's observability link.
The Grafana dashboard can be found by going to the
Active Clusters
page and clicking on the Observability link.
Developing Metrics, Dashboards and Alerts
¶
Metrics
¶
The Outshift Platform supports metrics exposed through a Prometheus
/metrics
endpoint or delivered to an OpenTelemetry OTLPHTTP endpoint.
Dashboards
¶
Cluster, SAAS, and aggregate dashboards are supported.
Alerts
¶
Cluster, SAAS, and aggregate alerts are supported.
Logs
¶
The application's logs emitted to stdout are automatically collected with OpenTelemetry and sent to the
Cisco Cloud Observability (CCO)
Platform.
For more details, see the
Logging
documentation section.
