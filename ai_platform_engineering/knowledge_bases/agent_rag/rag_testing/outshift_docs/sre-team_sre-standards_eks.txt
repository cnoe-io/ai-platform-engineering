ET&I EKS Naming Conventions
¶
At present, the k8s cluster naming convention is as described below.
Shared Clusters
¶
Shared clusters are clusters that run multiple applications for a particular source and should be named as follows:
<source>-<environment>-<AWS region short name>-<instance-number>
For example:
platform-dev-use2-1
- Platform specific apps (IAM for example) that are shared
cnapp-prod-euc1-1
- CNAPP apps that are shared across multiple apps
genai-prod-use2-1
- GenAI apps that are shared
Dedicated Clusters
¶
Dedicated/sandbox clusters for ventures should be named as follows:
â ï¸ Note: We are adding the short name of the AWS region to the names
<VENTURE_TEAM_OR_FUNCTION><ENVIRONMENT>-<AWS REGION SHORT NAME>-<INSTANCE_NUMBER>
For example:
dragonfly-prod-euc1-1
: First dedicated production cluster in eu-cental-1 for Dragonfly venture team
dragonfly-prod-euc1-2
: Second dedicated production cluster in eu-cental-1 for Dragonfly venture team
dragonfly-prod-use2-1
: First dedicated production cluster in us-east-2 for Dragonfly venture team
obs-prod-use2-1
: dedicated cluster for observability apps (e.g. OTEL)
ENVIRONMENT is either prod, staging or dev
â ï¸ Note: We have existing clusters that do not comply with the above pattern for historical reasons. For example:
cil-appnet-3
â¬ï¸âto "Home Page"
