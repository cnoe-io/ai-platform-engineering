!!! warning This documentation is deprecated, we are using splunk now for observability
Overview
¶
Grafana Dashboards that need to be visible at an organizational level, not specific to a given Kubernetes cluster, are installed in
Outshift Platform Central Observability Grafana
Organization metrics consist of a filtered subset of metrics aggregated by the SRE team to Amazon Managed Prometheus and AppDynamics. Dashboards using those metrics can be called "disassociated" or "unbundled", as they're neither tied to a cluster nor a project/app.
Outshift Platform Central Observability Grafana
integrates with Amazon managed prometheus and CloudWatch data sources.
Team Folders
¶
Tip
Applications will provide a
Cisco Active Directory Group
to associate with a team folder
Dashboards must be created within a team folder. If your team does not have a folder, please create an
SRE service desk ticket
, and
provide a Cisco Active Directory group
that represents the users in your team who will require access to the team folder.
If your team does have a folder, but you do not have access, please work with your team to be added to the active directory group.
