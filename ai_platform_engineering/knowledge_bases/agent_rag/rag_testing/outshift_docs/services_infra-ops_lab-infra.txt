ETI Labs Infra
¶
ETI has labs in Paris and SJC9.
Labs are equipped with BareMetal, VMWare VSphere, Tanzu K8s Clusters.
Best practice on labs usage
¶
We do have a requirement that our labs need to be secured and stable. For doing so, you need to review these rules / best practice. This will prevent us having vulnerabilities / labs issues.
When weâre talking about resources in the lab, this could be a container, a VM, a devices (UCS / Cisco AP etcâ¦), ESXi, Meraki devices, router, switch etcâ¦
Best practices
¶
Make sure to contact the SRE lab manager before using the lab so that weâve got information with regards to your project usage / requirements
Make sure that any resources plugged in the lab is not running EOL software
Ensure your resources are in the ETI lab inventory

Rules
¶
Every resources created in the lab should comply with InfoSec policy
Your resources need to be tag (project name and/or POC) in a the lab inventory and/or vCenter folder, VM name or something else that could simplified the identification process in case of vulnerability or failure where the resource could be impacted (power outage, hardware failure on a ESXi etcâ¦)
Change the default password and make sure this is a strong one to prevent (CVE-1999-0508,CVE-1999-0502,CVE-2015-7755)
