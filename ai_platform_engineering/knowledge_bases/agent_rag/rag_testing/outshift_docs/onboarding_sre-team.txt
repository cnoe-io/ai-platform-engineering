welcome
Welcome to the SRE team
Â¶
This onboarding process should guide you in your first couple weeks to get started with your new role,
but feel free to come back here later if you need to refresh your memory.
One of your peers should guide you through the onboarding process.
Feel free to ask questions!
If you don't find something in the documentation or you think there is room for improvement,
feel free to send a PR to
this repository
.
Ready? Let's
get started
