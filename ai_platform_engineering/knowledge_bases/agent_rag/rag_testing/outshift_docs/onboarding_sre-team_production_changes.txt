SRE Production Environment Changes
¶
As a SRE team best practice, we need to follow a standard procedure for
production environment
changes.
Here is the standard procedure to follow:
A.  Create a
"Method of Procedure (MoP)" document
that will be referenced during the production change.
This will act a playbook during production change and any unaccounted changes are reconciled in the MoP.
B.  Notify
Outshift Platform Status
and/or other relevant spaces.
Use the
Notification template
for notification in the space.
C.  Pair up with an observer to watch over shoulders for significant changes.
Note
SRE Production environments include anything our ventures depend on for their day-to-day operations, not just end customer production environments. For example: eks-dev-3 is our production environment, where as eks-sre-4 is our test environment.
Change Plan
¶
Steps for executing the changes should be clearly identified and validated in nonprod environments (i.e., dev/staging)
prior
to scheduling the roll-out to production.
Steps in the change plan should be written in such a way that anyone on the team can successfully execute the change.
Be
specific
about the action required. E.g., Include the full command that needs to be executed.
Example:
Log into cluster with
<the complete login command>
Do
NOT
assume prior knowledge/context necessary for successfully executing the change.
Change Roll-Out
¶
Once the steps have been verified, a "buddy system" will be leveraged for rolling the changes out to
production
environments, as described below.
At a minimum, there should be at least 2 individuals engaged in the roll-out process:
the
Driver
who executes the changes.
the
Observer
who provides a "second pair of eyes" as the driver exeuctes the changes. The Observer should also take notes on any gaps, findings, or otherwise noteworthy discoveries encountered during the execution of the change.
