Send SRE-ETI Inventory In SJC16 To Repo Depot
¶
As we are not planning to continue using SJC16 lab anymore and already powered off most of our(ET&I) assets, we have to empty/clear out the lab space that's being allocated for us.
SJC16 is a shared lab that many organizations use for their development/test environments, as you can see in the lab-map diagram.\
The lab space allocation renewal is done on a yearly basis by WPR and it will be renewed in the first week of May, 2022. So, ET&I will be charged if the inventory is not moved out from the allocated space before the last week of April.

To make the moving process simpler or easier to do or understand we have marked the racks with a colored stickers, red-sticker for the racks that will be scrapped and green-sticker for those who will stay or not to be moved. However, there are couple of racks in Row13A that VPP team requested to keep the TopOfRack switches (
Row13A: rack2, rack5, rack7 and rack8
) and it has been marked per item with a green-sticker .
Sample pictures.
