Creating a R53 eticloud subdomain
¶
Once you've created a new AWS account, it's good to have a sub-domain of
eticloud.io
. This domain is part of the top-level AWS
eticloud
account; any EKS, sandbox or other resource(s) can leverage this R53 domain as a part of our naming convention/hierarchy. For example, the
scratch-c.eticloud.io
sub-domain is the default R53 domain for the AWS
scratch-c
account.
We will use that example to illustrate the R53 routing to be done while creating a new AWS account.

new AWS account R53
¶
In your new AWS account, go to the
R53 service
in order to create a new hosted zone:
Name this new zone as ACCOUNT_NAME.eticloud.io.
Once created, you should have 4 name servers (NS) attached to it starting with ns- prefix as bellow:
Copy all those NS as they will be required on the next step.
Routing the eticloud sub domain
¶
Now, we will create the sub domain route in the eticloud R53 hosted zone so that all traffic will be redirect to the right hosted zone previously created.
Go to the
eticloud.io hosted zone in the AWS eticloud account
and create a new record:
Put the AWS account name create on previous step (ACCOUNT_NAME), select NS and put the 4 name servers from the previous step, should be like that:
