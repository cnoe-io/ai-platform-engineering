How to clone a VM without vCenter
¶
Find a way to create two copies of the VM named NetHunting-2, even without the clone feature since we do not have any vcenter Appliance in the DMZ
ESXi host link:
https://192.168.199.12
Username: root
Password: (see keeper)
The cloning steps:
¶
Connect to the ESXi server which hosts the VM (NetHunting-2)
In the left menu click on Storage
In the central pannel click on Datastore browser
Click on Datastore1(1), then create a directory to store the .vdmk file of the VM you want to clone (NetHunting-2), in my example i have created a directory named NH2-vmdk
Select NetHunting-2 directory, then select its NetHunting-2.vdmk file and copy it to the NH2-vmdk directory
Now go back to the left menu then :
Click on host
Create/Register VM
In select creation type select create a new virtual machine
Give a name to the new VM (Pixies-1 in my example), and as Guest OS Family and Guest OS version, choose the same as those of the VM which we want to clone
Select any available Storage option
In customize settings step, remove the Hard-disk-1, click on add hard disk/existing hard disk, choose the .vdmk file under the NH2-vmdk directory then click next.
In the last step click on finish
The new VM is created, to check the creation you can go to the left menu then click on Virtual Machines
As the new VM is a clone, it keeps the IP address of the original one so it's important to change it.
