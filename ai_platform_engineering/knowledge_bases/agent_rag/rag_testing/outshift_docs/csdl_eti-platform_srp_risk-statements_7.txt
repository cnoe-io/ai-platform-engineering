BCR-01.01
Inadequate disaster recovery planning, documentation, and testing increases risks to recovery
¶
Description
¶
The ETI SRE team currently does not have a well defined disaster recovery plan (DRP).
Specifically, the following elements of the DRP are unclear:
central list of resources
recovery priorities based on criticality, business value, and dependency of services
confirmation of the recovery of a resource or data
frequency of testing
Business Impacts
¶
Availability
Business Continuity
Reputational Damage
Likelihood: High
¶
A loss of services, large or small, is a built-in assumption of any cloud operations model and recovery from that loss is a requirement.
Risk Level Category: High
¶
The ETI SRE team has built quit a bit of redundancy and failover into our systems. However, we have not adequately described our plan for disaster nor have we begun testing what plan does exist. Until those occur, the risk of catastrophic platform failure is very high.
