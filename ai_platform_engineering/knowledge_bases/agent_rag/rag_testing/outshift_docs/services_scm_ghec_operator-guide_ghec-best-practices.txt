Creating New Repos
¶
In general, new repos are created in much the same way as on
wwwin-github.cisco.com
(GHES); navigate to the organization's home page and click the green "New" button to the right:
Security Matters
¶
Care must be taken
when creating new repos in GHEC to ensure they are not accidentally exposed to the public internet.
GHEC resides within the cloud, so
incorrect security settings can expose any given repo to the internet at large;
while there are use cases for this, it is generally not desirable and presents a potential risk.
Repos have three levels of visibility:
Public
--
anyone who can access
github.com
(this means
anyone!
) can see the repo's contents
Internal
-- only Cisco enterprise members can see the repository
Private
--
you
explicitly define who can see (and commit to) the repository
Recommended Settings
¶
For the reasons above, the ET&I SRE team recommends that new repos are created with their visibility set to
Internal
as shown below:
If the
gh
utility is installed and logged in, this may also be accomplished via the command line, similar to the following:
gh
repo
create
cisco-eti/sre-ghec-repo
--internal
Note that
the repo's visibility can be changed at any time
by a user with appropriate permissions to do so; as such, it's generally best to start with more restrictive permissions and then open them up if/when needed later on.
