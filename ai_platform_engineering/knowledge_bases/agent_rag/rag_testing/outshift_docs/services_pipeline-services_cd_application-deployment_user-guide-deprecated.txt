Application Anatomy
ArgoCD Architecture within ET&I
Overview
¶
To prepare your application for deployment within the ET&I SRE platform:
Prepare your application for deployment (create deployment repo) following this pattern "venture-name-deployment", for example: "kosha-deployment", "cybear-deployment" ...
Deployment repository contains three main folders:
applications
: your helm values that override the default one
clusters
: your cluster config where you will deploy you application
applicationsets
: your applicationsets, which will deploy your kubernetes resources
Create request for SRE to:
add your ArgoCD Project (if it doen't already exist)
Create an ArgoCD Application
Ask also for argocd applications permissions in order to sync ...
Note: Creating argocd projects and appProject via running manualy jenkins job or via CLI is DEPRECATED.
Let's get started!

ArgoCD Project and Application
¶
Typically, related applications are grouped into an ArgoCD "project". This makes it easier to find applications within the deployment environment.
The SRE team has created a dedicated repository to define argocd project and also argocd appProject which will create your applicationsets based on deployment repository.
Please ask SRE team to create this.
