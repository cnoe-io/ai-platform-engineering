How-to add yourself to a repository in GHEC (cisco-eti) org
¶
This document will guide you through the new process of adding yourself with permissions to one of our GHEC (GitHub Enterprise Cloud) org
cisco-eti
repos using
Safe-Settings
Step 1: Locate the YML repo file and edit
¶
Go to the
admin
repo located in our GHEC org and locate the relevant repo
yml
file
here
Note
If you are unable to access this repository or do not have `write` access please reach out to our SRE team
Edit the
yml
file and add your GitHub username to the
collaborators:
section
For example:
collaborators:
- username: tvaintrob # GitHub username
permission: admin # admin, pull, push, <custom role>
Note
If this section does not exist, it may be commented out, or you need to add a new section, please refer to the
Safe-Settings User-Guide
for more information
[OPTIONAL]
If you would like to add a team instead of a user, please add one here as well
For example:
teams:
- name: ui-platform-guild  # Change to the required team name
permission: maintain # admin, maintain, triage, write, read
Commit + Push + Create a new PR for the changes to sync, this process will trigger some extra checks/validations
Please reach out to the SRE team for review via your dedicated SRE for <
Venture-Name
> WebEx space
Step 2: Accessing the repository
¶
Upon the successful merge of the modified
yml
safe-settings file, you should be able to access your repo from
here
Note
Sometimes this may take a few minutes, if it takes more than ~5 minutes please reach out to the SRE team for debugging
