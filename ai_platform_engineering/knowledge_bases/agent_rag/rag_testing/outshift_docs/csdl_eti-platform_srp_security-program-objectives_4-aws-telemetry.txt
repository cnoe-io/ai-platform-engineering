Risk(s) Addressed

AWS telemetry is insufficiently integrated to central monitoring and alerting
Description

The ET&I Platform relies on various AWS services. AWS provides several metrics about
the healthiness of these services that can help to prevent and mitigate business continuity issues.
These metrics should be identified and integrated into the Platform's monitoring stack and alerting mechanisms.

Critical AWS services' telemetry data are integrated into the ET&I Platform's central monitoring stack, including but not limited to:
Bastion logs
EC2 instance monitoring
RDS logs
RDS monitoring (replication lag, number of replicas)
SES quotas
