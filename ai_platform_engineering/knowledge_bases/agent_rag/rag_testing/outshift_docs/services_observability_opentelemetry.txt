OpenTelemetry
¶
OpenTelemetry
is a collection of tools, APIs, and SDKs. Use it to instrument, generate,
collect, and export telemetry data (metrics, logs, and traces) to help you analyze your softwareâs performance and behavior.
Overview
¶
In December of 2022, the SRE team began a PoC to test and establish a pattern of use for
OpenTelemetry
.
Ultimately, the team aims to use
OpenTelemetry
to support the aggregation of telemetry data
in an effort to provide a single lens through which to view platform health. This not only helps ventures to understand
the behavior of their various applications, but also helps the SRE team to ensure that they are meeting SLAs by reporting
any range of SLIs necessary to ensure the platform is performing as required.
