Plan and implement Disaster Recovery processes
¶
Target Date: FY??Q?
¶
Risk(s) Addressed
¶
Inadequate disaster recovery planning, documentation, and testing increases risks to recovery
Lack of copy of the backups in a different AWS region may make recovery attempts impossible in the event of losing multiple availability zones in a region
Lack of copy of the backups under a different account with limited access may result in data loss in case of the compromise of the eticloud AWS account
Critical S3 buckets are not backed up
Lack of backups of DNS records might make recovery attempts impossible in case of a disaster or accidental deletion
Current backups of secret storage does not provide sufficient solution for recovery from certain type of disastrous events
Inadequate database backup validation hinders disaster recovery
Description
¶
The ET&I SRE team will identify the gaps in the current disaster recovery processes and practices and will
develop and document a comprehensive disaster recovery plan.
Definition of Done
¶
The ET&I SRE team has a documented Disaster Recovery plan which includes:
an inventory about the critical infrastructure components and data storage solutions
backup storage and lifecycle policy (location, retention of the backups, etc)
disaster recovery testing processes
a roadmap to resolve the current known gaps, including but not limited to:
backup of Route53 DNS records
backup of critical S3 buckets
