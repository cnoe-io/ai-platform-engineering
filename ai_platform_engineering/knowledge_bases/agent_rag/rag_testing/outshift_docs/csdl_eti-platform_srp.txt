Security Readiness Plan Overview
¶
Introduction
¶
The overall purpose of the Security Readiness Plan (SRP) is to provide a vehicle whereby:
The ETI SRE team can:
Assess security weaknesses.
Describe the risks in risk statements.
Describes our mitigation plans in Security Program Objectives.
ETI leadership is able to understand the associated risks and planned mitigations in order to:
Approve the mitigation plans, timelines, and resourcing.
Understand and accept the level of risk until mitigations are completed.
Understand and accept any risks which will not be mititgated.
OR:
Reject the SRP and require the ETI SRE team to re-evaluate.
The SRP is built around creating clear and comprehensible:
Risk Statements
: What are the individual risks to the ETI Platform?
Security Program Objectives
: How will the ETI SRE team mitigate those risks?
Scope
¶
This document is intended to be limited to the Emerging Technology and Incubation (ETI) Platform's production environments. The Platform is defined as the collective production runtime environments used to develop and operate the Individual Operating Units (IOUs) within ETI. Those runtime environments are a variety of resources in the Amazon Web Services (AWS) account
eticloud (626007623524)
and include, but are not limited to: Elastic Cloud Compute (EC2) resources, object storage (S3) resources, AWS Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) resources, AWS Relational Database Service (RDS) resources, and AWS CloudFront (a Content Delivery Network - CDN) resources.
Risk Statements
¶
Risk Statements describe individual risks to the ETI Platform and include:
A single sentence title to identify the risk and its potential impact or impacts.
A short description more concretely identifying the flaw and its components.
Business impacts to identify the effects of non-remediation.
A risk likelihood category (High/Medium/Low) that describes both the potential frequency of a risk and existing mitigations, if any.
A risk level category (High/Medium/Low) that includes the severity of the impacts and any current mitigations to those impacts.
A unique ID generated when the risk statement is entered in the
ETI Platform Security Insights (SI) SRP
.
Possible sources of risk statements could be:
Unmet Cloud Control Framework (CCF) controls
Penetration testing
Threat modeling
Rapid Risk Assessment (RRA)
Consulting with an S&TO Security Architect
ETI Platform risk statements are grouped by their collective CCF family.
Threat and Vulnerability Management
¶
Non-activation of Nessus on instances may result in undetected malicious software
Business Continuity Management & Operational Resilience
¶
Inadequate disaster recovery planning, documentation, and testing increases risks to recovery
Lack of copy of the backups in a different AWS region may make recovery attempts impossible in the event of losing multiple availability zones in a region
Lack of copy of the backups under a different account with limited access may result in data loss in case of the compromise of the eticloud AWS account
Critical S3 buckets are not backed up
Lack of backups of DNS records might make recovery attempts impossible in case of a disaster or accidental deletion
Current backups of secret storage does not provide sufficient solution for recovery from certain type of disastrous events
Inadequate database backup validation hinders disaster recovery
AWS telemetry is insufficiently integrated to central monitoring and alerting
Monitoring solution used by ET&I Platform might be not suitable for ensuring business continuity requirements and uncertain future of development can be sources of potential security risks
Secret storage service (Keeper) degradation may result in failures amongst applications that relies on secrets
Distruption in Let's Encrypt certificate issuer's service may lead to downtime of ET&I Platform hosted websites and applications
Data Security and Privacy Lifecycle Management
¶
Production systems inventories are insufficiently detailed
Cryptography, Encryption & Key Management
¶
Current implementation of secret storage exposes secrets those who has administrative access to Kubernetes clusters
Governance and Risk Management
¶
Production systems are not well defined
Infrastructure & Virtualization Security
¶
Lack of network-level access restriction on Kubernetes clusters provides a huge attack surface for internal or external malicious actors
No separated storage for infrastructure and hosted application logs, excessive amount of application logs can make the infrastructure log pipeline unreliable
Possible gaps not covered by Intrusion Detection Systems may inhibit the detection and effective reaction to malicious activity
Third party publishing systems (Harbor) publicly accessible on the Internet may have currently unspotted vulnerabilities that can be exploited and can lead to customer data exposure or unauthorized access
Denial of Service tooling is not as robust as possible
Application & Interface Security
¶
Third-party applications hosted under the .eticloud.io with inadequate cookie security settings provides attack surface for cross-subdomain cookie attacks, information leakage through cookies, and other type of attacks
Identity & Access Management
¶
Unnecessarily broad permissions may lead to privilege escalation
Gaps in audit logging imlementation may impede security incident investigation and prevention
Applications deployed on ET&I Platform can access secrets of other applications or secrets that used for managing the underlying infrastructure
Production monitoring system is publicly accessible from the Internet without Cisco VPN connection and may be vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks or zero-day vulnerabilities in the third-party authentication system
Possible gaps in employee offboarding process may lead to unauthorized access to restricted systems
Security Program Objectives
¶
Security Program Obectives (SPOs) are both security goals to remediate specific current risks as well forward-looking goals that improve the overall security and business posture of the ETI Platform. They can be short-term, tactical goals or longer-term strategic goals. They may address single risk statements, combine several risk statements, or address portions of risk statements, depending on the desired goal.
SPOs should include:
A short title clearly describing the goal.
A target date defined by a Cisco Fiscal Quarter and Year end.
The risk, risks, or portions of risks addressed.
The relevant CCF control or controls addressed.
A description that provides contextual and operation detail implementation details that can include:
Specific work items to be completed.
Estimates of time and effort required to complete the work.
A Definition of Done (DoD) listing the concrete outcomes required for the objective to be considered complete.
An objective status in one of four states:
Not Started - work has not yet begun.
In-Progess - resources have been allocated and the team is actively working on mitigation.
Completed - the DoD has been met.
Accepted Risk - the ETI SRE team has accepted the risk or risks and provided justitification for that acceptance.
A unique ID that is generated when the SPO is entered in the
ETI Platform Security Insights (SI) SRP
.
ETI Platform SPOs are listed individually as they may comprise multiple CCF control families.
