1/ On-call amendment does not distinguish primary or secondary, so track the same way.
2/ On-call standby hours:
Week days : enter the number of on-call stand-by hours (excluding on-call worked hours) for each day in Workday. Note that on-call stand-by hours have to be non-standard hours. The number of standard hours is 40 per week, so with 8 hours / day, you will need to enter 24-8=16 hours max of standby per day during week. For example, if your usual standard worked hours are 9:00-17:00, you enter on-call stand-by hours between 0:00-9:00 and between 17:00-24:00, from which you need to exclude on-call worked hours.
Weekend days: enter the number of on-call stand-by hours (excluding on-call worked hours) for each weekend day in Workday.
3/ On-call worked hours:
For week days and weekend days, enter the number of worked on-call hours for each day in Workday.
