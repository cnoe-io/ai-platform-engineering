CNAPP - CWPP
¶
Note
This venture was previously named SecureCN
Purpose
¶
This CISCO venture provides
Cloud Native Application Security
throughout the
Dev Lifecycle
by giving a wide variety of security features/solutions.
"A Kubernetes-native platform delivering security for containers and Kubernetes. It leverages the power of Kubernetes and the service-mesh layer to secure containers and cloud-native applications.
With a single Panoptica pod deployment (running as an admission controller), DevOps can leverage the power of our "agent-less" (not a DaemonSet) solution to protect from vulnerabilities across images, containers, Kubernetes, and runtime deployments."
