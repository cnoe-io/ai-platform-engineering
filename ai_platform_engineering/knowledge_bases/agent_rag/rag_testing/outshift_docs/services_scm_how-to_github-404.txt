How do I resolve wwwin-github 404 on accessing a project/repo link
¶
tag:
github 404
Background:
¶
wwwin-github.cisco.com
is accessible to everyone in Cisco, but it doesn't allow anonymous access to projects like public github.com
Users have to be signed in before accessing a project or repo
Note:
Users may notice 404 behavior if they haven't used wwwin-github webui in a while and they have been logged out
Solution:
¶
Access desired link like
https://wwwin-github.cisco.com/eti
Upon seeing 404 page, click on the "sign-in" page on the top right hand corner
Retry accessing the project/repo link again
Note: unlike most logins at Cisco,
do not
use
@cisco
.com for your login, just your CEC ID
