ET&I Multi-Cluster Application Deployment
Â¶
The ET&I Platform manages multiple Kubernetes clusters in
pre-defined service-level environments
with varying degrees of operational support and security hardening as appropriate for different stages of application development.
CI/CD pipelines
ensure that applications can be built once and deployed to multiple target clusters as it is promoted to subsequent service-level environments. See the
ET&I Environment Definitions
page for details on the characteristics and gating requirements for deploying your application to these environments.
The
Application Deployment Architecture
page describes the technical details of how ET&I SRE team uses ArgoCD for deploying applications to multiple clusters.
