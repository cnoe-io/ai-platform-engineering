Databases
¶
Postgres
¶
Managed Postgres
¶
The ETI Platform offers
AWS Aurora/RDS
as a production-grade, managed database solution.
In-cluster Postgres
¶
For development purposes, the ETI Platform offers running Postgres in Kubernetes.
Unlike for production-grade data solutions, there are no guarantees about availability and persistence,
so they cannot be used for production services.
Postgres Operators are
currently under evaluation
Object Store
¶
ETI Platform uses AWS S3 for object store.
In-memory database / Cache
¶
Managed Redis
¶
The ETI Platform offers
AWS ElastiCache
as a production-grade, managed in-memory database solution.
In-cluster Redis
¶
For development purposes, the ETI Platform offers running Redis in Kubernetes.
Although it's not suitable for production use cases,
it can be an acceptable (preferably short-term) solution if (and only if) losing the data stored in Redis has no effect on the application.
Message Streaming Kafka

ETI Managed SDM
¶
Current guidance that ETI Plaform will provide a managed Kafka instance thru SDM for development purposes
