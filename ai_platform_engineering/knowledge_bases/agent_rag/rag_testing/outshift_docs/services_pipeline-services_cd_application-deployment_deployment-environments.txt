ET&I Environment Definitions
¶
To ensure clear segregation between production and non-production workloads, the ET&I Platform defines 4
Service-Level Environment Types
. This page describes the characteristics and gating requirements defined for each environment to ensure that developers can rapidly iterate application changes
without
impacting the reliability and security of customer-facing products.
These environment definitions also ensure that the ET&I Platform complies with the
Cloud Controls Framework
(e.g.,
Change Control and Configuration Management
,
SCF-IVS-09.03
).
All of the following environments, including the non-production
dev
and
preview
environments, are intentionally built to honor the same application contracts described in the
Application Onboarding doc
to eliminate friction from promoting the same application artifacts to subsequent environments.
Dev
¶
Deployment Stage
: The first deployment stage where changes can be validated in a non-production kubernetes cluster
Customer Impact
: None
Access Control
: permissive access-control policy to grant developers access for troubleshooting
Pre-requisites
:
CI/CD pipeline contract requirements
Notes
:
successful deployment/validation in this environment is a
pre-requisite
to promoting the same change to the next deployment stage
since this is the first stage for deploying and validating new changes, the environment is more volatile
Preview
¶
Deployment Stage
: A production-like environment where not-yet-released features can be previewed by special external userse (e.g., Design Partners)
Customer Impact
: Early Access customers only (e.g., Design Partners)
Access Control
: Highly restricted access-control policy to protect the security and reliability of the environment
Pre-requisites
: Successful deployment and validation in
dev
environment
Notes
:
primary use case for this environment are projects that are still in early development stages (i.e., not yet fully hardened for security), but must also be shared with external entities for early feedback
Staging
¶
Deployment Stage
: An optional stage where changes can be further validated in a more production-like and stable environment
Customer Impact
: None
Access Control
: Highly restricted access-control policy to protect the security and reliability of the environment
Pre-requisites
: Successful deployment and validation in
dev
environment
Notes
:
this environment is built to more closely resemble production environment, including external infrastructure/services (e.g., CloudFront)
all
workloads, including applications, are subject to
security vulnerability SLAs
depending on the project, this may or may not be a required deployment stage
Production
¶
Deployment Stage
: The final deployment stage where hosted services are used by real end-user customers
Customer Impact
: All GA customers
Access Control
: Highest level of access-control restrictions to protect the security and reliability of the environment, as well as customers' privacy
Pre-requisites
:
Successful deployment and validation in
dev
and/or
staging
environments
Application Observability
High Availability
Agreement on
shared responsibilities for meeting CSDL controls
Notes
:
all
workloads, including applications, are subject to
security vulnerability SLAs
