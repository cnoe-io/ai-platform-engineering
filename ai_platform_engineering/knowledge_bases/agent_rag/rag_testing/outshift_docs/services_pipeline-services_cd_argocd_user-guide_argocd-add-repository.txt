Add a Repository to ArgoCD
¶
ArgoCD must be able to clone your repository before it is able to manage your deployment(s). Therefore, your GitHub
organization must allow access to the "bot" or generic account ArgoCD will use to accomplish this.
Typically this access is set up only once, the first time ArgoCD attempts to clone from a new GitHub organization.
Allow User Access
¶
In most cases, the
eti-sre-cicd.gen
user is used by ArgoCD to access the GitHub server.
Allow this account access to your GitHub organization.
Add Organization to ArgoCD
¶
Note
The git password is a Github Personal Access Token and
NOT
the generic user AD password
For example, GH Enterprise Server Personal Access Token for eti-sre-cicd.gen is store
here
(under key
ghe_argocd_token
)
In ArgoCD's settings, browse to "Repositories" and click "Connect repo using HTTPS".
Populate the form as required for the new GitHub organization, similar to this:
Once complete, this may be saved as a credentials template, so that it may be used by multiple projects and applications.
At this point, ArgoCD should now have appropriate access to GitHub so it can deploy and manage your application! ð
