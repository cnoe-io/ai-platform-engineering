IVS-13.02
Denial of Service tooling is not as robust as possible
¶
Description
¶
The Platform infrastructure utilizes AWS Shield Standard for Denial of Service (DoS) and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack mitigation. 
This provides defense against the most common, frequently occurring network and transport layer DDoS attacks, however does not offer protection from application layer (layer 7) attacks, so applications still vulnerable to layer 7 (such as HTTP) attacks. 
Communications regarding such attacks falls on AWS in the event of an incident.
Business Impacts

Denial of Service
Business Continuity
Reputational Damage
Performance
Availability
Likelihood: Low
¶
The current production services deployed on the Platform have a low risk of likelihood of attack. In the eventuality that an attack occurs and Shield Standard is not sufficient, Shield Advanced, a paid product, is relatively easily deployed.
Risk Level Category: Low
