disaster recovery
Lack of copy of the backups in a different AWS region may make recovery attempts impossible in the event of losing multiple availability zones in a region
¶
Description
¶
AWS resources - such as RDS for databases, or S3 for storing files - used by the ET&I Platform exist in a single region, each region consist multiple availability zones that are isolated from faults in the other zones.
In an event of the loss of multiple availability zones in a region, the backups can not be accessed, thus recovery from such a scenario is not possible.
