Dex
¶
Dex
is an OIDC (OpenID Connect) identity provider that federates identities across various upstream providers.
Dex has proven useful in a variety of different use cases (eg. Banzai Cloud integrated it into their products to allow customers using their own IdPs while keeping the applications agnostic of them).
The SRE team maintains a
forked version
of Dex to solve some of the
shortcomings of Cisco SSO
.
Dex will soon be available as a managed service and ventures will be able to use it to easily integrate Cisco SSO into their applications.
