All the current SCS repositories are held in
GHEC

cisco-eti
organization.
They are manged and used by the
Haim's Group

In addition SCS team holds a separate GHEC org for testing vulnerable apps and research purposes. The org is called
scs-sandbox
. This is purposefully isolated and has limited access to other teams. The list of repositories used may be found
