Deploy Customer Development Environment(s)
Â¶
An EKS cluster may have one or more customer applications running at any given time.
The deployment will consist of an inventory of the applications and a migration plan that takes into consideration the application's availability requirements and customer schedule.
If the migration is occurring between accounts or requires a new RDS instance, application data will need to be migrated in coordination with the application owner team.
In all other cases, applications should be stateless, and use external data and caching resources, or caching that can be reset.
Provided those prerequisites are met, the following steps would be taken:
Add a cluster target to the ArgoCD
workflow with appropriate helm values for the target.
Test the functionality of the application using cluster-specific endpoints.
Add the cluster-specific endpoints to traffic routing.
(Optional) If a side-grade is occurring, remove the old cluster from traffic routing.
