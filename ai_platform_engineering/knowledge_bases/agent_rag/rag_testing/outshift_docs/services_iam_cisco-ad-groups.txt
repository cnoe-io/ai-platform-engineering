What are Cisco AD Groups?
¶
Cisco MyID Groups
Â is Cisco's self-service tool to manage
Active Directory
groups and memberships.
AD group membership is used to provide
Role Based Access Control (RBAC)
for various Cisco applications that use
Cisco SSO
.
Note
Cisco SSO itself does not perform any authorization, it passes the
member_of
group claims to the target application to perform further claims checks and authorization.
Some of the example of applications that use Cisco AD groups are
AWS SAML Assume roles
,
wwwin-github
,
Keeper (vault)
, etc.
