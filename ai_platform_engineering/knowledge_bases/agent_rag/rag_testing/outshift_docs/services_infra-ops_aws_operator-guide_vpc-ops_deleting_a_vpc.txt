Troubleshooting
¶
Sometimes, when deleting a VPC, resources that are in use will prevent the VPC from being deleted. There will be links to the individual resources in use. They are likely to be Network Interfaces tied to either:
* VPC Endpoints (available in the VPC console).
* Load Balancer(s) (available in the EC2 console).
Deleting the associated resource should clear the error and allow the VPC to be deleted.
