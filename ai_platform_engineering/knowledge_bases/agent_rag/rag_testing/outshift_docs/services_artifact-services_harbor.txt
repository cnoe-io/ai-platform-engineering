Harbor
¶
Harbor is an open source trusted cloud native registry project that stores, signs, and scans content.
Harbor extends the open source Docker Distribution by adding the functionalities usually required by users such as security, identity and management.
Having a registry closer to the build and run environment can improve the image transfer efficiency.
Harbor supports replication of images between registries, and also offers advanced security features such as user management, access control and activity auditing.
The ETI Platform offers Harbor as a managed service to teams with artifact distribution teams,
but at the same time advises teams to treat Harbor as an implementation detail whenever possible
(ie. rely on the OCI registry interface not the fact that it's backed by Harbor).
Shared instances
¶
There are two available shared Harbor instances managed by the SRE team at the moment.
If you think none of the following instances fit your needs, please talk to your SRE contact to discuss setting up a dedicated instance.
