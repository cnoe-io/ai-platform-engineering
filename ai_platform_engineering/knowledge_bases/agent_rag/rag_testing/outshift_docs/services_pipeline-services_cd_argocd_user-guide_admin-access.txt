Administrative access
¶
Users logged in via SSO can be granted full access to ArgoCD.
As a result, the builtin administrative user is usually disabled.
Use the admin credentials only if something goes wrong and logging in via SSO does not work properly.
Credentials for the admin user are stored in Keeper (check out the
list of ArgoCD instances
).
When the admin user is enabled, a login form shows up on the web UI login screen.
To login as admin from the CLI, lose the
--sso
flag from the login command:
argocd
login
--grpc-web
argocd.yourdomain.com
Username:
admin
Password:
<Admin
password>
Kubernetes secret
¶
That admin password is included in the
argocd-initial-admin-secret
Kubernetes secret in the
argocd
namespace of a given ArgoCD Kubernetes cluster:
kubectl
-n
argocd
get
secret
--context
<argocd-k8s-cluster>
argocd-initial-admin-secret
-o
jsonpath
=
"{.data.password}"
