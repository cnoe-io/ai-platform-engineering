log4j CVE-2021-25741
¶
Base CVSS Score: 10
¶
What:
¶
Apache Log4j <=2.14.1 JNDI features used in configuration, log messages, and parameters do not protect against attacker controlled LDAP and other JNDI related endpoints. An attacker who can control log messages or log message parameters can execute arbitrary loaded from LDAP servers when message lookup substitution is enabled. From log4j 2.15.0, this behavior has been disabled by default.
Reference
Versions Affected: all log4j-core versions >=2.0-beta9 and <=2.14.1
