Alert Routing
¶
Outshift platform supports two types of alert routing.
Alert Routing in Kubernetes Cluster using AlertManager
Alert Routing in Central Observability Grafana
Refer to Obervability Architecture Overview
When to use cluster local alerts and central grafana alerts
¶
Cluster Local Alert Recommendations:
¶
Cluster local alerts are great for deployment notifications like rolling upgrade failures, pod crashes and auto-scaling issues with HPA/Karpenter.
Central Grafana Recommendations:
¶
All application SLI metrics are sent to Central Amazon Managed Prometheus, hence application business/operational SLOs are best measured and alerted in Central Grafana.
