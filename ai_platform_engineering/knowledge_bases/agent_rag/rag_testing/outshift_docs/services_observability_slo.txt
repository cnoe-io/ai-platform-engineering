Service Level Objective (SLO)
¶
An SLO is a service level objective: a target value or range of values for a service level that is measured by an SLI. A natural structure for SLOs is thus SLI â¤ target, or lower bound â¤ SLI â¤ upper bound.
Example:
For Loading a webpage, an SLO that our average search request latency is less than 100 milliseconds.
