Daily standup
¶
Daily standup is known from many management and software engineering methodologies.
It's a proven technique to quickly notice if something keeps engineers from doing their jobs,
so that delays in delivery can be minimized.
We get together every day to give a quick update about what we work on.
This is a good time to ask for help if you need any.
Don't be shy about asking for help, even if you think you should be able to solve a particular problem:
maybe the universe is just not letting that happen.
Weekly staff meeting
¶
Every week we get together to discus top of the mind issues or any topic really that concerns SRE.
We usually start with an on-call hand off: engineers finishing their on-call rotation
summarize the most important events that happened and let the team know about anything that's actionable (ie. needs fixing or more attention).
Following the on-call hand off everyone talks a little bit about personal and professional accomplishments happened since the last staff meeting.
This is the meeting when Reinhardt usually shares important news about ET&I and whether we can expect any work falling out of those.
He also regulary collects feedback about ET&I events.
Bi-weekly planning
¶
Although we don't work in sprints, we get together every two weeks to discuss ongoing projects and to adjust priorities if necessary.
This is the place for some Jira maintenance as well: not everyone is comfortable with Jira, so asking for help or reorganizing tasks is possible here.
Bi-weekly demo
¶
Every two weeks (the week after planning) we get together to demo some of the work we've been doing in the previous weeks.
Whether it's a new tool that you introduced, some changes you made in an existing system or just some improvements somewhere,
this is the place to show it.
On-demand ceremonies

Working sessions
¶
Working together remotely is hard, but it's extremely important, especially now that we are working remotely:
- This is one of the few opportunities to share knowledge with and get feedback from your peers
- You get to meet your peers outside of the regular ceremonies and get to work with them on problems
Some people thrive on working in teams, some might prefer working alone, but everyone needs help or an extra pair of eyes from time to time.
Scheduling working sessions for a specific topic with a few peers is a good (and often more fun) way to solve problems or complete tasks together.
