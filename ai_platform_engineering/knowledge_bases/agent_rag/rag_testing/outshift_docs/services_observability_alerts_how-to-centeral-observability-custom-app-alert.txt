from
step #1
to
step #3
Step 2: Create Alert Rules in Grafana
¶
Alert Rules
¶
Navigate to SRE central observability
grafana
Follow the instructions to create an alert rule getting started section.
Get started
Create an alert rule by adding queries and expressions from multiple data sources.
Add labels to your alert rules to connect them to notification policies
Contact Points & Notification Policies
¶
If your team does not yet have a PagerDuty contact point or needs a new notification policy, please create a service request ticket with the platform team as these are part of Grafana global configuration.
Be prepared to provide the PagerDuty service link that includes the integration key, and the labels you wish to trigger alerts.
Verify Alerting
¶
Once the alert rule is associated you should begin seeing alerts. You can also trigger a test alert from your alert rule.
Utilize the
PagerDuty Service, Escalation policy, Events API integration
from the above step to add a pager duty contact point.
You should be able to see the new ALert Rule, ContactPoint and Notification Policy in Grafana.
If everything is set correctly, when the Alert Rule threshold is passed, you will get a notification alert on the Webex space.
