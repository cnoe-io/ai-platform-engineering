In-cluster Redis
Â¶
In-cluster Redis is a service provided by the ETI Platform on Kubernetes
for development purposes
.
Teams can easily spin up their own Redis instances in their development environments without SRE involvement,
but there are no guarantees or SLA for the service. As a result, it's not suitable for production use cases.
