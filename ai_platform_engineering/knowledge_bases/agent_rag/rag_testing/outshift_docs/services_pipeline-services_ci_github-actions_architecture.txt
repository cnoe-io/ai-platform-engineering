Github Actions concepts
¶
A
workflow
is the execution of some tasks, which are referred to as "jobs". Workflows are similar to pipelines in jenkins
Workflow is specified in
.github/workflows
in the target repo
Each workflow contains one or more
jobs
.
A
job
is defined as a group of one or more
actions
(custom/marketplace)
An
action
is defined as a custom application for the GitHub Actions platform that performs a complex but frequently repeated task.
A
runner
is a machine where the action runs-on
Github
event
is trigger to run a workflow. An event could be a pull request or a code merge to a specific branch.
Note
Github Actions a set of standard actions from GitHub Marketplace or custom written.
Many common build/deploy tasks are available in GitHub Marketplace. This makes Github Actions a very powerful and extensible tool.
