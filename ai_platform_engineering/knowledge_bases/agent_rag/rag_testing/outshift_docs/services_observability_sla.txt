Service Level Agreement (SLA)
¶
SLAs are service level agreements: an explicit or implicit contract with your users that includes consequences of meeting (or missing) the
SLOs
they contain.
The consequences are most easily recognized when they are financialâa rebate or a penaltyâbut they can take other forms.
An easy way to tell the difference between an SLO and an SLA is to ask "what happens if the SLOs arenât met?": if there is no explicit consequence, then you are almost certainly looking at an SLO.
SRE team works with Product Management to define SLAs as there are business consequences of setting this number.
