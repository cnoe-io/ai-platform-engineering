In SJC09/Pirl Labs do not have a good resources monitoring system and we are not aware or get alerts if a resource instance goes down unless we go to the existing monitoring systems and see what's going on. in general, we either see a resource is not reachable when we try to use it or the client/developers get connectivity issues to their resources and ask us on webex spaces.
Note:
