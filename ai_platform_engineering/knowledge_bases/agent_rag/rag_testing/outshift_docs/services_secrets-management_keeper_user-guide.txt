Getting access to Keeper
¶
Teams in need of a secret management solution can reach out to the SRE team for Keeper access.
SRE team can set up and grant access to team's dedicated namespaces.
Generally
a namespace will look something like this:
eticloud/apps/team-name
.
Namespaces usually come with two roles:
admin
developer
(default)
Developers can read everything and modify some secrets, whereas admins have full access within a namespace.
Role membership is managed through
Cisco Groups
.
Contact the SRE team to add/remove members to/from the above roles.

ETI Platform deploys the
External-Secrets operator
