Service Level Indicator (SLI)
¶
An SLI is a service level indicatorâa carefully defined quantitative measure of some aspect of the level of service that is provided.
Measurements are often aggregated: i.e., raw data is collected over a measurement window and then turned into a rate, average, or percentile.
Examples:
Request latency:
How long it takes to return a response to a request can be a key SLI.
Error rate:
Expressed as a fraction of all requests received
System Throughput:
How many Requests Per Second(RPS) can a system serve?
Examples:
platform-demo
provides an example implementations of a service
health check and instrumented health metrics
.
After these health metrics have been implemented and deployed, you can
create Grafana dashboards
tailored to monitoring the health of your service.
