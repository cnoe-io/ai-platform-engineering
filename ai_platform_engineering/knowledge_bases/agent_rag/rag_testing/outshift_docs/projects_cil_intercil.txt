ETI SRE CIL Interlab project
¶
This project aims to connect all CIL labs within the same network as per the diagram bellow:
Requirements
¶
As this will rely on Cisco Meraki devices, there is a requirements on having direct access to the internet. Also, there is a need to have compute resources per CIL labs.
Paris lab setup
¶
In order to support the Interlab project within the Paris lab, we will need then to configure the DMZ with regards to the current setup which means:
having a DHCP server so that the Meraki devices can have IP address. Currently, everything is statically defined on local network 192.168.99.0/24 which is also mapped to 173.38.152.28/30 and is available externally:
this is currently handle by the DMZ Gateway so there is no need to installed dedicated DHCP server
both subnets are setup, need to update labs documentation
having a compute server: we could reuse
this UCS C220 M4
which needs to be moved to the DMZ and also reset. 3 ethernet cables, 1 x CMIC, 2 x Ethernet and the CMIC should have an IP of 172.20.16.10 255.255.255.0 with a gateway of 172.20.16.1+
UCS has been moved and is now in the
DMZ R01 rack
with right tags/labels
connectivity has been done as per CIL requirements.
compute env: this is going to be VMWare setup and this will be setup/managed by CIL team
CIMC has been setup and now CIL will manage the VMWare configuration
