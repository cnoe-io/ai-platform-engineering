Cloud Native Application Observability (CNAO)
is Ciscoâs software-as-a-service (SaaS) product for observing, securing, and optimizing large, managed Kubernetes deployments on public clouds (Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Red Hat OpenShift).
It provides real-time observability across your entire technology stack: applications, software-defined compute, storage, services, network, and other infrastructure, through the collection and correlation of metrics, events, logs, and traces (MELT).
Cloud Native Application Observability is powered by the Cisco Full-Stack Observability (FSO) Platform, making it extensible to add new capabilities to meet a broad scope and future observability needs.
