SJC09 OBSERVIUM ALERT MANAGEMENT
¶
In this document we are capturing the high level overview of where to check if observium alert is received. The alert notification will contain some useful information about the affected host.
For ESXI servers
¶
If the host is an ESXi server, you can
login
to
eti-sj9-vcenter
into
eti-sj9-vcenter
and check the server in UI.
Check if it's powered off and try to power it back on.
If it's powered on, but you cannot still access the esxi server UI
(hostname.cico.com/IP)
on the browser,
login
and search the esxi server in
eti-lab-inventory
, get the CIMC IP address and open the CIMC IP address on the browser.
Find the ESXi server CIMC access information in
vault
For Linux hosts
¶
Try to ping the hostname or IP address, if it's not responding,
login
to
eti-sj9-vcenter
and find the host from the inventory list.
Check if it's powered off and try to power it back on.
You may need to try to connect the host from the web console in the vcenter for further troubleshooting.
