How to Create CI/CD Jobs in Jenkins
¶
There are three primary types of Jenkins jobs as described
here
;
our recommended approach is to create "Multibranch" pipeline jobs using automation as described below.
Creating a Multibranch Pipeline Job -- the Automated Way
¶
Using our automated job creation job is recommended.
Navigate to the
create_new_multibranch_pipeline_job
in Jenkins
Click on
Build with Parameters
in the navigation bar on the left
Populate the build parameters/text fields as required:
GIT_URL
is the GHE instance in which the repo resides
GIT_REPO
is the name of the repo
only
. As indicated,
do not add the full GitHub URL
.
FOLDER_NAME
must be
Demos
. (We will move the job later.)
GIT_ORG
is the GitHub organization in which the repo resides. Set as appropriate.
JOB_NAME
may be set as required.
CREDENTIAL_ID
leave unchanged/use the default.
Click on the "Build" button at the bottom
Create a Folder
¶
Create a folder for the venture's Jenkins job(s).
Note:
If the application is for demo purposes, please leave the job at its default location.
Navigate to the
eti-sre
folder
Click on
New Item
Enter a
Folder Name
according to that particular Venture
Select
Folder
in the options then click
OK
Move the Job
¶
Move the Jenkins Job into the venture's folder.
Navigate to the
Demos folder
where the job was created
Select your application's job folder as created earlier (
venture-test-folder
in this example)
Click on
Move/Copy/Promote
in the navigation bar on the left
Select the path to your application's new folder:
Click on
Move
Next Steps
¶
Navigate to your Jenkins job location to follow its progress
You'll notice that a
deploy
folder has been created in addition to the
build
folder.
This is related to the deploy stage of the current CI pipeline where the linked deployment job results will be shown.
You'll need to create an application in ArgoCD to manage its deployment; please follow
this guide
.
