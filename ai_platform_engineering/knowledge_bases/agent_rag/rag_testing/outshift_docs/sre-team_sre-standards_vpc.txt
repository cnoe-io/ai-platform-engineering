ET&I VPC Naming Conventions
¶
At present, the VPC naming convention is simple: we use the same name for the VPC that we use for the its associated k8s cluster.
dragonfly-prod-euc1-1
(EKS cluster) has a VPC named
dragonfly-prod-euc1-1
When creating VPC for RDS, MSK, Elasticsearch, other stateful services, we will use the data to signify it.
dragonfly-prod-euc1-data
If the VPC is not directly associated with a k8s cluster, choose a name that is appropriate and descriptive of its intended use.
