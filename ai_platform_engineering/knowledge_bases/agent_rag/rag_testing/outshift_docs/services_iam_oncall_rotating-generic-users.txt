Rotating Generic User Password
¶
Password rotation for generic accountsÂ is performed at
ADAM
.Â
Outshift Platform Engineering team is notifed about password expiration via email.Â
Verify that the old password works first (pull from the Keeper) and then set a new password.
ââââ- âââUse
Generic/Search
to find specific generic users.
Name wildcard can be used like
eti_sre*
or
eti-sre*
. but not all follow that convention (frontline).
If you suspect an account is no longer in use, consider "pausing" it, watch for errors over a period of time, then deleting it.
Whenever we rotate a secret, validate the information in this table and update as required, especially if a problem is found after a rotation.
