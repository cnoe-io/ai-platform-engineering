How to upgrade a Cisco UCS old firmware version
Â¶
We periodically need to perform various operations in our labs on our UCS servers requiring server access via the CIMC. 
However, some of our UCS servers have old firmware versions, so access to CIMC requires the use of an old browser that supports Adobe Flash Player.
The goal is to update the CIMC with newer firmware so that we can access it with modern web browsers since Adobe Flash Player is no longer distributed or supported.
In the event of the circumstances described above, this document provides a step-by-step guide outlining an approach for upgrading the CIMC version.
