Creating Sandbox Infrastructure
Â¶
In general, the process to create a new sandbox is relatively straight-forward:
Use the
reference repository
as a template to create a
   new repository for the (new) sandbox infrastructure.
Add Terraform resources into this new repository by copying and modifying examples as explained for
creating vpc
and
creating eks cluster
.
Deploy the new resources with Atlantis.
Additional detail regarding how to prepare the environment is provided in the
reference repository's
README.md
; note that effort is
required from both the venture as well as SRE. Once the (new) repository has been prepared and the infrastructure is in
place, if required, some components may be accessed via SSH as outlined in the sections that follow below.
