Users
¶
Generally speaking, individual users should not be created. Typically, a
role
is created. There are use cases where a user is appropriate:
Temporary users - when users have a pre-defined expiration (as in use for a temporary account for a hackathon)
terraform admin - for use by Atlantis.
If users are created, they should not be allowed console access, and their secrets should be stored in Keeper.
Roles
¶
A role is a pre-defined identity for a user, service, or application that delegates access for a limited amount of time. It has one or more
policies
attached to it that define the access level available to users who assume the role.
Roles should be created after policies.
If a role is created for a user or users, the role should be managed by
Cisco Groups automation
.
Policies
¶
A policy is a document that describes exactly what resources a user or role can access. Policies should be created before users or roles as they apply to both.
