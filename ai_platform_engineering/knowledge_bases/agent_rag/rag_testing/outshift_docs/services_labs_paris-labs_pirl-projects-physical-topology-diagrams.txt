PIRL projects physical topology diagrams
¶
The diagrams below focus on the physical representation of the  infrastructure cabling of the Outshift projects
operating in the lab. Therefore, we intentionally omitted, for some of these infrastructures, the representation of gateway devices as well as the uplinks to the internet for the sake of simplicity and clarity. The objective is to provide better visibility of the connections between each server and the access switches to the Out-of-Band Management (OOBM) network (via PIRL-CORP-SW) and the data VLANs (via PIRL-NXS-A and PIRL-NXS-B).
