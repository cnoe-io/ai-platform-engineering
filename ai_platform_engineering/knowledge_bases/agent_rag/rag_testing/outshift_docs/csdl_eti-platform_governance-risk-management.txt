Tools

The SRE team uses Terraform and Atlantis for infrastructure as code automation.
Terraform
¶
Terraform
is human-readable, declarative infrastructure as code. It allows the SRE team to quickly and repeatedly create cloud infrastructure.
Atlantis
¶
Atlantis
is Terraform pull request automation.
An infrastructure repository is branched with new or modified code. When a pull request is submitted, Atlantis automaticallly runs a Terraform plan against the changed code and the plan output is recorded in the pull request as a comment. Another member of the SRE team reviews and approves the code, and the code submitter comments with a command to run an Apply. The coded resources are then created in the appropriate AWS account.
Repository
¶
The primary repository for Terraform code is
sre-tf-infra
.
Production Atlantis instance

Instance Image Hardening
¶
The SRE team only uses pre-hardened images from
Cloud 9
.
The AMIs for EKS are not modified.
The AMIs used for ssh bastion EC2 instances:
Have a script added to create users from an S3 bucket.
Have netcat installed.

AWS Account Hardening
¶
The ETI SRE team regularly runs
compliance gap analysis in JupiterOne
. This compliance gap query includes scanning against the CIS AWS Foundations Benchmark.
In addition to these regular scans, the ETI SRE will team provide evidences for the
CIS AWS Foundations
framework in JupiterOne in alignment with the CSDL assessment.
The evidences will be published in .pdf format with the
JupiterOne Compliance Gap Query Results

tag: GRM-02.03
Risk assessments will occur twice yearly or any time a major change to the platform occurs. Major changes are defined as changing functionality that alters the threat model.
Risk Mitigation
¶
tag: GRM-08.01
The ET&I SRE team will anually review its risk mitigation techniques, including, but not limited to, examining infrastructure as code lifecycles, build and deploy processes, and threat models.
