here
Documentation
Github Enterprise
- Our current source of truth for most documentation, particularly anything that is closely coupled with code (e.g., README for a specific tool).
Jira
- Task-related notes, comments, logs. Include links and references to Github and Sharepoint as needed.
Sharepoint
-
Deprecated
- Former home for documents about how we do our work, how something is designed, runbooks, etc. The majority of the resources have been moved to GitHub (as above), however a few things can still be found here.
SRE Public Site
- knowledge shared with external venture teams
SRE Internal Site
- knowledge shared within SRE team
Meeting Notebooks
- capture discussions from meetings with venture teams here
Conventions
Conventional Commits
- commit message format
Naming Conventions

-  overview of the overall landscape and interaction points with venture teams
Reinhardt's
slides
- vision and goals for SRE in ET&I
ETI Multi-Cluster Deployment Architecture and User guide

[?]
Solutions Architecture
-
this page seems to be for new/developing proposals, but the latest notes are from back in Feb. Have the topics listed there been discussed/documented elsewhere?
- [#TODO: validate/update existing docs]
Environments
¶
The SRE team owns and manages multiple Kubernetes clusters deployed to AWS, GCP, and Cisco-owned OpenStack environments.
They are all tracked
here
.
eks-sre-1
is a shared sandbox environment and a good starting point to experiment with.
On-call Preparation
¶
Once you log in to Jira a checklist task should be assigned to you. You should aim to complete that checklist in the first couple weeks.
Refer to the
On-Call Onboarding Checklist
page for additional context for each checklist item.

Jenkins CI pipeline creation
Jenkins job
Deployment repo
platform-demo-deployment
Jenkins CD (
ArgoCD
) creation
Jenkins job
