Environments policy usage
¶
Cisco InfoSec defines the following polices for accessing cloud services
Cloud Infrastructure Security Standard-AWS
Cloud Infrastructure Security Standard-GCP
Tip
Using SRE Terraform/GitOps based Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) takes care of security and compliance items such as hardened images or ingress configuration.
Scratch account usage
¶
In some cases scratch account usage need clear ET&I policy as we're providing them with extended privileges. So we're not requiring full compliance on those accounts which are not prod but we do require:
Tip
Always set firewall/ingress/security groups to
Cisco CIDRs
Here is a
reference example CIDRs
Tag alls resources in compliance with
Cisco Tagging Standards
Intentionally Vulnerable account usage
¶
Outshift offer many security products to end customers hence there is an increasing need to verify the attach paths with
Intentionally Vulnenrable Accounts
Current guidance with Cisco InfoSec,
Adam Callis
and Outshift is to use the legacy lightspin AWS org as the home for future AWS Vulnerable testing.
Please contact SRE team if you have a need for such access
