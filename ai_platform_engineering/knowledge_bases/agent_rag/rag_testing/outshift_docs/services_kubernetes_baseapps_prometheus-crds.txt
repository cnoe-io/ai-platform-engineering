Prometheus CRDs
Â¶
Prometheus Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) are used by Prometheus Operator under monitoring.coreos.com. These CRDs simplify the deployment and configuration of Prometheus, Alertmanager and related monitoring components.
SRE team installs Prometheus Operator CRDs to remove circular dependency to install core baseapps before observability stack is ready.
