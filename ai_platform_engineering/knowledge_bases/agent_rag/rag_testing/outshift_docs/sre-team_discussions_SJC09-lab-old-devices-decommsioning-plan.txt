Decommissioning Old Devices and Accommodating Potential GPU Hardware Installation Plan(SJC09 Lab)
¶
Objective:
¶
The objective of this plan is to efficiently decommission old devices in sjc09 lab.
Phase 1: Assessment and Inventory
1. Conduct a comprehensive audit of the existing network infrastructure to identify all old and obsolete compute and networking devices.
2. Create a detailed inventory of the old networking and compute equipment, including their make, model, age, and current condition.
3. Analyze the power consumption and cooling requirements of the current equipment to plan for accommodating the GPU hardware.
Phase 2: Decommissioning and Disposal
1. Prioritize idenfiying with labels the most outdated old compute & networking devices.
2. Carefully decommission the old compute and networking devices following proper procedures to avoid any disruption to ongoing operations.
3. Safely store the decommissioned devices, and make them ready to ship to repo-depo.
4. Update documentation to reflect the changes made during the decommissioning process and maintain a clear record of the network layout.
Phase 3: Create Accommodation for GPU Hardware
1. Identify suitable locations within the server room to install the GPU hardware.
2. Ensure the selected location has proper power supply and cooling capacity to support the new GPU devices.
3. Implement necessary infrastructure upgrades, such as additional power outlets, cooling systems, and cable management, to accommodate the GPU hardware.
4. Configure the rack space and mounting solutions to securely house the GPU hardware and connect them to the network.
Phase 4: Network Redesign and Optimization
1. Reevaluate the network design to optimize traffic flow and minimize potential bottlenecks after the GPU installation.
2. Plan for network adjustments to ensure seamless integration of the GPU hardware and avoid conflicts with existing equipment.
3. Test the network performance to validate the improvements achieved through GPU hardware installation.
Phase 5: Testing and Validation
1. Perform thorough testing of the newly installed GPU hardware to ensure they function correctly and meet performance expectations.
2. Test the entire network infrastructure to verify the improvements and optimizations achieved through the replacement and upgrades.
3. Address any unforeseen issues or performance gaps during the testing phase.
