ArgoCD ignoreDifference sync option
¶
ArgoCD is a continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes that allows you to declaratively manage the desired state of your application. The ignoreDifference sync option in ArgoCD allows you to specify fields or paths in the manifests of your application that should be ignored during the synchronization process. This means that if there are any differences between the desired state defined in your manifests and the actual state of your application, ArgoCD will not take action to reconcile those differences if they are in the fields or paths specified in the ignoreDifference option. This can be useful in situations where there are certain fields or paths that are automatically generated or managed by other systems and should not be modified by ArgoCD.
