Creating an EKS Cluster for Shared Services & Applications
Â¶
In general, creating a
shared Kubernetes cluster
for multiple services and applications is similar to creating a
dedicated sandbox cluster
; the key difference is that we (SRE) do not create a dedicated repository for each new VPC & k8s cluster.
The workflow for creating a new sandbox cluster is outlined
here
. As described above, we simply
skip step 1
(creating a new repository) and place the configuration into the
sre-tf-infra
repository.
The process then becomes:
Create a branch on the
sre-tf-infra
repository.
Add Terraform resources into your branch as required.
Deploy the new resources with Atlantis.
Not sure what/how to name it? Take a look at our
naming conventions
.
As a final step, you'll need to
add our shared services
to the new cluster.
