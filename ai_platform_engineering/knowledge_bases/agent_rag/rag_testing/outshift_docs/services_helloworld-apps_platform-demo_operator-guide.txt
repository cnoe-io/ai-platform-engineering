Platform-Demo Operator Guide
¶
This is an example of an "
On-Call Playbooks
" page. It is operational best-practice to ensure that any alerts you configure for you application provides a link to its relevant "playbook" (aka "runbook") that explains what the alert means, and how it can be resolved by the on-call support.
See Rob Ewaschuk's
My Philosophy on Alerting
for more alerting best-practices.
Alert:
platform-demo-down
¶
Tags: platform-demo-down
Context
¶
This alert is triggered when the platform-demo app's
self health-check
determined that it was down.
Resolution
¶
Check which of the service's dependencies are causing the service to fail:
Navigate to the service's Grafana dashboard at TBD
Check the
Dependencies Health Check
panel to identify which component is down
Follow the playbook for that component to restore service
