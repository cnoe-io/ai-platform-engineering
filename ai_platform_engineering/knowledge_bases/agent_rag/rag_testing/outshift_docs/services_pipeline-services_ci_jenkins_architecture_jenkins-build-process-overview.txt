Consistent Build Process via Pipeline Library
Â¶
A
standard build pipeline library
is made available to all teams/ventures within ET&I, providing cookie-cutter build, publish, validate, scan, deploy, test pipeline for any generic cloud native application.
The library is imported by the consumer's
Jenkinsfile
as outlined
here
.
The behavior of the library is tunable to an extent for each application; its various stages and configurable options are documented
here
.
The pipeline library itself is maintained
here
.
Changes to the library are immediately available to any project or job that uses it, simplifying (security) patches and updates.
