Description
¶
The ETI Platform use AWS SES as an SMTP service for email sending.
AWS SES has a quota for sending rate and specific recommendations for complaint and bounce rate.
This has two implications:
exceeding the sending quota will result in email sending errors
exceeding the complaint or bounce rate may result in SES account review and suspension
Lack of alerting based on the related metrics may make these problems undetected.
