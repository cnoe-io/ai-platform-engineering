Vowel Sagemaker Endpoint Demo Connector with REST API
¶
This an example microservice that demostrates connectivity to AWS Sagemaker endpoint and exposes a REST API to interact with sagemaker.
URL:
https://vowel-sagemaker-example.int.dev.eticloud.io
The microservice has the following features:
Source code
CI/CD Pipeline
with Jenkins and
Argocd
Runs inside kubernetes in the same namespace (vowel-dev) as other vowel apps.
Uses service role identity. Connects to a sagemaker endpoint using
AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity
REST API Endpoint to interact with Sagemaker endpoints. Checkout the
Swagger UI
Sample UI
to play with the models. I had little fun building this sample UI.
Example curl request that can be executed from desktop or inside the kubernetes clusters (with service url):
curl -X 'POST' \
'https://vowel-sagemaker-example.int.dev.eticloud.io/sagemaker' \
-H 'accept: application/json' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-d '{
"model": "jumpstart-dft-vowel-2-meta-textgeneration-llama-2-7b-f",
"query": "What is Cisco?"
}'
