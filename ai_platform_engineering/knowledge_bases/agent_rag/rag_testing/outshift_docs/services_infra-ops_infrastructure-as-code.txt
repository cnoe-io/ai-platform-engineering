Boundaries
¶
The inherent flexibility of cloud native computing ensures that there will be some fluidity regarding which tool and which group manages particular resources. Generally speaking, The Outshift SRE Platform takes responsiblity for cloud resources up to the service level. This responsibility includes accounts, identity access management, networking, compute, and managed service clusters. The instantiation, configuration, and operation of other services, cloud-based or not, should be discussed with the SRE team.

Terraform
¶
Terraform
is declarative IaC and language to codify resources.
The Outshift SRE team has written a series of
Terraform modules
for the most commonly created cloud resources. These modules provide guard rails for everyone to create secure and compliant resources.
