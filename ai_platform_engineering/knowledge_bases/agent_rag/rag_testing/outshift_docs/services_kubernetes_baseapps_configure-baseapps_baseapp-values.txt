Configure BaseApp Helm Values
¶
Configuration is applied to a base-app through helm
values
files.
When applying configuration,
common
configuration is applied first, followed by
environment
(dev staging prod) specific configuration. Common and environment specific configuration is defined once and shared across baseapps instances. 
* This configuration is stored in the
Shared Baseapps Configs Repo
with the following folder structure.
âââ common
âÂ Â  âââ <baseapp-name>
âÂ Â      âââ values.yaml
ââââ environment
âââ dev
âÂ Â  âââ <baseapp-name>
â       âââ values.yaml
âââ prod
âÂ Â  âââ <baseapp-name>
â       âââ values.yaml
âââ staging
Â Â  âââ <baseapp-name>
âââ values.yaml
Lastly the
cluster
instance configuration is applied with last
values.yaml
entry takes precedence over the first.
* This cluster instance configuration is stored in the
Baseapps Repo
for the ArgoCD that manages the target kubernetes cluster.
âââ clusters
Â Â  âââ <cluster-name>
Â Â   Â Â  âââ <baseapp-name>
Â Â   Â Â   Â Â  âââ values.yaml
As every helm chart has a different configuration, this document does not attempt to cover how to configure each baseapp, rather to explain the order and precedence of how
config.yaml
files are applied.
