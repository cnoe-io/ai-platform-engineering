"""Skill scan gating policy.

Centralizes the rule for which skills are allowed to be served to the
supervisor catalog and to dynamic agents. Used by every loader path
(``load_default_skills``, ``load_agent_skills``, supervisor hub
fetcher, ``dynamic_agents.services.skills.load_skills``) so the policy
can't drift between callers.

Policy
------
* ``scan_status == "flagged"`` is blocked **unless** the doc carries
  an ``scan_override`` sub-doc (set by an admin via the per-skill
  override route, with set_by/set_at/reason for audit). The override
  is the admin's "I trust this skill even though the scanner doesn't"
  assertion; both this policy and the Node-side ``applyRunnableGate``
  honour it iff ``ADMIN_SCAN_OVERRIDE_ENABLED`` is on (default). Set
  the env to ``false`` to remove the escape hatch entirely — overrides
  are then ignored and ``flagged`` is unconditional.
* ``scan_status == "unscanned"`` (and missing-status legacy rows)
  are blocked only under ``SKILL_SCANNER_GATE=strict``. The default
  is ``"warn"`` so deployments without the optional skill-scanner
  service still load skills; operators who run the scanner can flip
  to strict to refuse anything the scanner hasn't explicitly cleared.
* Anything else (``"passed"`` etc.) is allowed.

Why warn is the default
-----------------------
The skill-scanner is an optional sidecar (``SKILL_SCANNER_URL`` lives
in the UI tier). When it's absent, every skill is created with
``scan_status: "unscanned"`` (or no field at all for legacy/imported
rows). Strict-by-default in that environment makes every catalog
entry invisible to the runtime even though the picker can still see
them — i.e. "skill failed to load" with no obvious cause. Warn-by-
default makes the feature work out of the box and still gives
security-conscious operators a single env flip to lock down.

Why this lives in its own module
--------------------------------
Each loader needs the same decision but used to encode it ad-hoc with
inline ``$ne`` queries. Centralizing it means:

1. Adding a new ``"quarantined"`` status later only requires editing
   one function.
2. Tests can pin the policy table without booting Mongo.
3. Both Mongo query predicates (``mongo_scan_filter``) and Python-side
   dict checks (``is_skill_blocked``) share the same source of truth.

Why the override is a separate field
------------------------------------
The previous implementation set ``scan_status = "admin_overridden"``
to encode the override. That collided with every scanner write path:
any rescan (per-skill, scan-all, hub auto-scan after recrawl) would
blindly write ``scan_status = "flagged"`` again and silently nuke
the override. Splitting the signals means:

* ``scan_status`` always reflects the latest scanner verdict
  (passed/flagged/unscanned). Scan routes can keep writing it
  without coordinating with the override layer.
* ``scan_override`` (audit sub-doc with set_by/set_at/reason) is
  the single source of truth for "admin allowed this". Override
  routes set/clear this field only.
* The gate combines them: a flagged skill with an override is
  runnable; without one, blocked.

Strict mode and overrides
-------------------------
Under ``SKILL_SCANNER_GATE=strict`` the only allowed status is
``"passed"``. A flagged skill is therefore blocked in strict mode
regardless of whether an admin override exists — strict means "I
trust only the scanner's clean verdict." This is the escape hatch
for regulated environments: setting strict ignores admin assertions,
by design.
