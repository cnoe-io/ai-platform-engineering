"""Deterministic precedence and merge for the skill catalog.

Precedence order (highest wins):
  1. default  (filesystem / MongoDB built-in skills)
  2. agent_config  (projected from agent_configs collection)
  3. hub  (external sources like GitHub; earlier registration wins among hubs)

When the same skill ``name`` appears from multiple sources, the highest-
precedence source wins.  Among hubs the catalog calls them in registration
order so the first hub's copy wins.
