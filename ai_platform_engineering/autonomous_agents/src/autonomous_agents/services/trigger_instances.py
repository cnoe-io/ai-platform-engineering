"""Webhook delivery dedup via the ``trigger_instances`` MongoDB collection.

Why
---
Most webhook senders deliver at least once. GitHub retries on a 10s timeout,
PagerDuty retries on any non-2xx, and operators occasionally replay payloads
manually for debugging. Without a server-side dedup table the autonomous
task runs once per *delivery* rather than once per *event*, which causes:

* duplicate side-effects (a Jira ticket created twice, two PR comments,
  two pages on-call),
* duplicate cost against the supervisor / dynamic-agents service,
* misleading run history that mixes "the agent ran twice" with "the
  sender retried twice".

This module turns the autonomous-agents service into "exactly-once" w.r.t.
sender retries by recording every accepted delivery in a Mongo collection
keyed on a unique dedup key. A second delivery whose dedup key collides
with an existing row is rejected at the front of the webhook handler and
the *original* run id is returned to the sender.

Dedup key precedence (see :func:`derive_dedup_key`):

1. ``WebhookTrigger.dedup_header`` is configured AND the request carries
   it -> ``f"{task_id}:hdr:{header_value}"``. Most senders give us a
   stable per-delivery id (``X-GitHub-Delivery``, ``X-PagerDuty-Webhook-Id``,
   ``X-Stripe-Signature`` t-component, etc.); using it directly is the
   most reliable strategy.
2. The webhook is signed AND we just verified the HMAC ->
   ``f"{task_id}:sig:{signature_hex}"``. The signature is a
   sha256(secret, timestamp + body) and is *already* computed for auth,
   so we get dedup for free with zero new hashing logic.
3. Neither -> no dedup is possible. The route logs a warning and runs
   the task without recording a row. Operators who want dedup must
   either configure ``dedup_header`` or enable HMAC signing.

The collection has a TTL index on ``received_at`` so abandoned dedup
records age out (default 7 days, configurable).
