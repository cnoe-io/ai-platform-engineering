"""Chat history publisher -- surfaces autonomous runs in the UI's chat history.

IMP-13 + spec #099. Operations folks live in the chat sidebar; autonomous
task runs that never appear there are effectively invisible. The Mongo
implementation writes each task's lifecycle events as a tagged
conversation (``source: "autonomous"``) into the existing
``conversations`` + ``messages`` collections used by the Next.js UI, so
a single ``?source=autonomous`` filter shows "what did the autonomous
agent do today?" alongside human chats.

This module defines the Protocol + no-op fallback only; the Mongo
implementation lives on
:class:`autonomous_agents.services.mongo.MongoService` and is exposed to
callers via :class:`~autonomous_agents.services.mongo.MongoChatHistoryPublisherAdapter`.
Keeping the Protocol here means scheduler / routes / tests depend on a
driver-free module, and the Mongo path is opt-in at lifespan wiring
time (``CHAT_HISTORY_PUBLISH_ENABLED`` must be True *and* the Mongo
connection must succeed).

Design
------
* **Opt-in.** ``CHAT_HISTORY_PUBLISH_ENABLED`` defaults to ``False``.
  We never touch UI collections unless an operator explicitly enables
  the feature, because the UI Mongo schema is owned by another package.
* **Same Mongo cluster, optionally different database.** Defaults to
  the same ``MONGODB_URI`` / ``MONGODB_DATABASE`` used by the run
  store; ``CHAT_HISTORY_DATABASE`` overrides only the database name
  when CAIPE puts chat data on a separate logical DB. Both databases
  are served from the *same* ``AsyncIOMotorClient`` that ``MongoService``
  owns -- no second connection pool.
* **Deterministic ids.** Conversation ``_id`` is
  ``uuid5(_AUTONOMOUS_NS, f"task:{task_id}")`` -- one conversation per
  task, stable across runs. Messages are keyed on ``message_id`` with
  per-run prefixes (``run:<run_id>:request`` / ``:response``) so
  multiple runs append rather than overwriting.
* **Best-effort.** The publisher is observability, not source of truth:
  a flaky chat database must never abort a scheduled task. Callers
  wrap every publish call in ``task_runner._publish_safely`` or the
  route-level equivalent so failures are logged and swallowed.
