"""Skill scan gating policy — vendored copy for the dynamic-agents service.

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
====================
This is a verbatim copy of
``ai_platform_engineering/skills_middleware/scan_gate.py``.

The ``dynamic-agents`` service ships as a standalone Docker image that
contains *only* the ``dynamic_agents`` package (see ``/app`` in the
container — there is no ``ai_platform_engineering/`` parent). Lazy
imports such as::

    from ai_platform_engineering.skills_middleware.scan_gate import (
        is_skill_blocked, mongo_scan_filter,
    )

…work fine in the dev monorepo (where both packages live on PYTHONPATH)
but raise ``ModuleNotFoundError`` inside the container. Until that day,
the broken import was caught by ``except Exception`` in
``services/skills.py::load_skills``, which silently returned ``[]`` for
every skill set — making every dynamic agent's ``SkillsMiddleware`` /
``StateBackend`` virtual filesystem appear empty to the LLM ("the
filesystem appears to be empty or inaccessible"). The supervisor
catalog and UI worked fine because they live in the same Python
process as ``skills_middleware`` itself.

So we vendor the policy module into the dynamic-agents package. The
file is small and the policy is stable; cost-of-duplication is low,
cost-of-broken-runtime is high.

KEEPING THE TWO COPIES IN SYNC
==============================
If you add a status (e.g. ``"quarantined"``) or change the default
gate, you MUST update both files:

    * ai_platform_engineering/skills_middleware/scan_gate.py  (source of truth)
    * ai_platform_engineering/dynamic_agents/src/dynamic_agents/services/scan_gate.py  (this file)

The unit test ``tests/test_scan_gate_vendored.py`` pins both the policy
table on this side AND that the public API surface (function names +
signatures) hasn't drifted from the source-of-truth module — so a
single-sided change will fail CI.

POLICY (matches the source-of-truth file)
=========================================
* ``scan_status == "flagged"`` is blocked **unless** the doc carries
  an ``scan_override`` sub-doc (set by an admin via the per-skill
  override route, with set_by/set_at/reason for audit). The override
  is the admin's "I trust this skill even though the scanner doesn't"
  assertion; both this policy and the Node-side ``applyRunnableGate``
  honour it iff ``ADMIN_SCAN_OVERRIDE_ENABLED`` is on (default). Set
  the env to ``false`` to remove the escape hatch entirely.
* ``scan_status == "unscanned"`` (and missing-status legacy rows)
  are blocked only under ``SKILL_SCANNER_GATE=strict``. The default
  is ``"warn"`` so deployments without the optional skill-scanner
  service still load skills; operators who run the scanner can flip
  to strict to refuse anything the scanner hasn't explicitly cleared.
* Anything else (``"passed"`` etc.) is allowed.
* The override is a separate sub-doc, NOT a magic
  ``scan_status="admin_overridden"`` value. That earlier design
  collided with every scanner write path: any rescan would blindly
  overwrite ``scan_status="flagged"`` and silently nuke the override.
  Splitting the signals lets scan routes write status freely and
  keeps the override stable.

# Default is "warn": flagged skills are blocked (unless an override

# History: this briefly defaulted to "strict", which silently broke
# every dynamic-agent skill in deployments without SKILL_SCANNER_URL
# configured ("N skill(s) failed to load"). The value-of-strict trade
# was a fresh deploy excluding unscanned content; the cost-of-strict
# was the feature being broken by default. Cost won.
