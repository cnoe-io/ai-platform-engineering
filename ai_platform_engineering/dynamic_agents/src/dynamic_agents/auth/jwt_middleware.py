"""Starlette middleware that validates incoming Bearer JWTs against Keycloak.

Spec 102 Phase 8 / T102.

For every request:

1. If the incoming request carries an ``Authorization: Bearer <jwt>``
   header, validate the JWT against Keycloak's JWKS endpoint
   (``OIDC_DISCOVERY_URL`` / ``OIDC_ISSUER`` / ``OIDC_AUDIENCE``).
2. On success, set ``current_user_token`` ContextVar so downstream
   ``services/mcp_client.py`` will forward this exact token (no
   re-mint, no swap) to ``agentgateway`` and downstream MCP servers.
3. On failure (expired / wrong-issuer / wrong-audience / signature
   mismatch), respond 401 immediately with a structured JSON body so
   the BFF can render a meaningful UI error. The request never reaches
   route handlers.
4. If there is **no** ``Authorization`` header at all, this middleware
   is intentionally lenient: it lets the request through and the
   existing ``auth.get_user_context`` dependency handles the
   ``X-User-Context`` legacy path. This is the rollout-safety hatch
   so the BFF can keep sending the trusted-header form for now;
   migrating the BFF to send Bearer is the matching change in
   ``ui/src/lib/da-proxy.ts``.

The two-path lenience MUST be removed once the BFF migration is
complete — at which point we hard-fail on no-bearer (FR-004 from
spec 102, Story 6 acceptance scenario 3).
