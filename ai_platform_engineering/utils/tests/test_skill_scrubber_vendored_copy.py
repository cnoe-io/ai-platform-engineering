"""Pin the vendored ``dynamic_agents`` copy to the source-of-truth.

The dynamic-agents container ships as its own deploy unit and does
not depend on the ``ai_platform_engineering`` package, so we keep a
byte-for-byte vendored copy of the scrubber under
``ai_platform_engineering/dynamic_agents/src/dynamic_agents/services/skill_scrubber.py``.

If they drift, traces from one of the two services will leak skill
content while the other doesn't — exactly the kind of silent
regression we want CI to catch.

The vendored copy carries an extra ``VENDORED COPY`` header block;
compare module bodies starting after that header to ignore it.
