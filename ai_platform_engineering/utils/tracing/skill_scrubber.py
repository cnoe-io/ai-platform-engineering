"""Operator-content scrubber for OpenTelemetry spans.

Problem
-------
The supervisor + dynamic-agents emit OTel spans through the Traceloop
(``opentelemetry-instrumentation-{langchain,bedrock,anthropic,...}``)
instrumentors. By default, those instrumentors stamp full prompt /
completion / tool-I/O bodies onto every span. Two classes of
operator-authored content end up echoed onto **every** step's span
that we want to keep out of Langfuse:

* **Skill payloads** — ``SKILL.md`` bodies and ancillary files loaded
  by the deepagents ``SkillsMiddleware``. Surface points:

  1. The ``## Skills System`` block in the system prompt
     (``gen_ai.prompt.<n>.content``) — metadata only today, still
     redundant on every step.
  2. ``read_file`` tool-call results when the agent loads
     ``/skills/<source>/<name>/SKILL.md`` or any ancillary file —
     this is where the bulk volume lives.
  3. The ``skills_metadata`` graph-state channel that Traceloop's
     LangChain instrumentor stamps as ``traceloop.entity.input`` /
     ``...output`` on each node.

* **task_config workflow prompts** — multi-paragraph operator
  instructions defined under ``task_configs`` in MongoDB / the
  fallback ``task_config.yaml``. Surface points:

  4. The ``tasks`` / ``todos`` graph-state channels (each entry
     carries the rendered ``llm_prompt``) — stamped on every node
     span by the LangChain instrumentor for the duration of a
     workflow run.
  5. The ``get_workflow_definition`` tool result, which renders
     every step's ``llm_prompt`` inside a ``## Workflow:`` block.
  6. The ``invoke_self_service_task`` tool span input/output — the
     tool's state-update return carries the full ``tasks`` array.

Setting ``TRACELOOP_TRACE_CONTENT=false`` would fix this but it also
wipes every chat / tool body globally, which kills debuggability of
non-skill flows. This processor does a scoped redaction instead.

Design
------
Implemented as an OTel ``SpanProcessor`` so we can rewrite span
attributes during ``on_end`` (after the instrumentor populates
them, before the OTLP exporter ships them). The redaction is
defensive — unknown attribute shapes pass through untouched, so a
bug here can never break tracing, only fail to redact.

We register the processor by attaching it to the active
``TracerProvider``. ``cnoe_agent_utils.tracing.manager`` installs
its own ``BatchSpanProcessor`` first; we install ours alongside.
The OTel SDK fans every span through every registered processor in
registration order, so as long as we install before the first span
fires (i.e. immediately after tracing init at app startup) we're
good.

Configuration
-------------
``SKILL_TRACE_SCRUB_ENABLED=true`` (default) — turn the scrubber on.
``SKILL_TRACE_SCRUB_PLACEHOLDER`` — the string that replaces redacted
content (default ``"[redacted: skill payload]"``).

Defensive size cap (orthogonal to skill scrubbing — protects the
OTLP exporter from Langfuse's nginx 413 limit when *non*-skill
attributes blow up):

``SKILL_TRACE_MAX_ATTR_BYTES`` — any string attribute above this
size, after skill scrubbing, is truncated with a marker. Default
``262144`` (256 KiB). Set ``0`` to disable.

Set ``SKILL_TRACE_SCRUB_ENABLED=false`` for one debug session if you
need to read raw skill prompts in Langfuse.
