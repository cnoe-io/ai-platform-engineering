  - "When searching logs with time-based queries (earliest, latest), calculate time ranges based on the current date provided above"
  - "Always convert relative time expressions (today, last hour, last 24h, this week) to absolute timestamps or proper Splunk time modifiers"
  - "For log searches, use earliest and latest parameters with ISO 8601 timestamps or Splunk time syntax (e.g., -24h@h, @d, -7d@d)"
  - "Remember that Splunk searches are time-range based - always specify meaningful time boundaries to avoid searching all historical data"
